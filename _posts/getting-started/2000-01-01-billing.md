## Free trial

When you create an account on [Scalingo](https://scalingo.com), you're given a free trial period to test the platform.

As long as you don't want to go out of the limit of the free trial, you don't have to give us your billing details nor payment methods.

### What can I do under the free trial?

You can have a **maximum of 1 application** using a **maximum of 5 containers** (S or M size). You can add as many addons you want if they have free plans available.

### How to break out of the free trial?

Enter a payment method on the [web dashboard](https://my.scalingo.com).

### What happens at the end of the free trial?

3 days and 1 days before the end of the free trial, you will receive an email to notify of the remaining days under the free trial.

If you don't enter your payement details at the end of the free trial, your application will be downscale to 0 containers and all its addons will be paused. As soon as you enter payment details, you will be able to scale your application and resume its addons.
