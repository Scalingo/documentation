Review apps are a *powerful collaboration tool* to discuss about a new features
between members of your organization. We implemented this feature as part of
our [GitHub integration]({% post_url platform/app/2000-01-01-github-integration
%}).

## What are review apps?

Let say that you have worked some hours on an awesome new feature. It's time to
show the world your work and to open a new Pull Request (PR) on GitHub (even if
it's not fully done). With Review Apps enabled on Scalingo, we will create a
new application (a Review App) with the code of the new feature. You can now
share the result of your work, to get it validated, with all people
involved, even if they are not in the tech field.

Maybe they will tell you to change something like adding tests or to change a
button color. You have to push your modification on the branch involved in
the PR to update the Review App.

Once all of our teammates are satisfied and the PR is closed, we will
automatically delete the review app. You can disable this behavior or add a
delay to fit your needs. This latter setting means that you can still review PR
after your dev team has closed the PR.

If you don't want to create a new review app for each PR you can also choose
among open PRs of your app to manually deploy a review app.

## Addons, collaborators and environment variables

If you've enabled Review Apps, a new application will be created every time a
new Pull Request is opened in your linked GitHub repository. This new
application is a child application. This child app will have a copy of add-ons,
collaborators and environment variables from the parent application.

## Configuration of review apps

Having a strict copy of the parent application is sometimes not wishable. You
might not want to copy production credentials, or it is sometimes required to
start a custom task after the initialization of the app, that's where the [scalingo
JSON manifest]({% post_url platform/app/2000-01-01-app-manifest %}) becomes useful.

As a quick example, here is a sample `scalingo.json` that customize the
environment variable `CANONICAL_HOST_URL` for a child app:

```json
{
  "env": {
    "CANONICAL_HOST_URL": {
      "generator": "url"
    }
  }
}
```

Here, the value of the environment variable `CANONICAL_HOST_URL` will contain
the URL to reach the newly deployed app. The `scalingo.json` configuration
always takes precedence on parent app configuration.

### Run a task after the first deployment of a review app

When a review app is created, you might want to execute a custom action like
seeding its database. This can be done using the `first-deploy` scripts in the
manifest `scalingo.json`. If such a property is defined, the given command will
be executed as a [postdeploy hook]({% post_url
platform/app/2000-01-01-postdeploy-hook %}) after the first deployment.

{% warning %}
This script replaces the `postdeploy` hook for the first deployment of a review app.
If a `postdeploy` is defined in your `scalingo.json` or `Procfile`, it won't be executed.
{% endwarning %}

```json
{
  "scripts": {
    "first-deploy": "bundle exec rake db:deploy db:seed"
  }
}
```

### Run a task after each deployment of a review app

To run a custom command after each deployment of a review app, you need to
define a [postdeploy hook]({% post_url platform/app/2000-01-01-postdeploy-hook
%}) for your application. However defining a postdeploy hook would also
impact the parent application.

To make sure only review apps are impacted, the common practice is to define a
custom environment variable in the `scalingo.json` file

```json
{
  "env": {
    "IS_REVIEW_APP": {
      "value": "true"
    }
  }
}
```

And use the environment variable in your postdeploy task to check if it is
executed in the scope of a review app or not.

## Is it possible to create review apps if my code is hosted at a different place?

We only implement directly Review Apps for code hosted on GitHub. However you can set it up for your
specific case thanks to the Scalingo API:

* Create a [child application]({% post_url platform/app/2000-01-01-child-apps %})
* Deploy a gzipped tar archive containing your code:
