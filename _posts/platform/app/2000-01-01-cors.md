## Context

Cross-origin resource sharing (CORS) is a mechanism that allows some resources to be requested from
another domain. This is usually the case for your application's assets such as fonts or images you
download from a CDN. If not configured properly, you might have errors downloading these assets.

On this documentation page, I will call _CDN_ the server where your assets are stored and _my-app_
your application hosted on Scalingo.

## Configuration

### On the CDN Side

The CDN must respond with the `Access-Control-Allow-Origin` header. The value associated to this
header must be either a wildcard (`*`) or the domain name of your application (e.g.
`https://www.example.com` or `https://my-app.scalingo.io`).

### On your application side

On your application side, you should include the `Origin` header with your domain name in it. Here
is how to do it with various languages:

#### Examples

* Ruby: use a gem such as [`rack-cors`](https://rubygems.org/gems/rack-cors),
* Node.js/Express: use a npm module such as [`cors`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/cors),
* Go: various middlewares exist depending on the web framework you use: this
  [one](https://godoc.org/github.com/gin-contrib/cors) for the
  [Gin](https://github.com/gin-gonic/gin) framework, or that
  [one](https://godoc.org/github.com/martini-contrib/cors) for
  [Martini](https://github.com/go-martini/martini). You can also have a look at this
  [one](https://godoc.org/github.com/rs/cors) which works on top of the standard library.
