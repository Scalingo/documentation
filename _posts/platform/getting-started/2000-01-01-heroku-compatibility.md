title: Heroku Compatibility
tags: heroku

Our aim for Scalingo is to be fully compatible with Heroku. If your app works
on Heroku, it will work on Scalingo. We've added several compatibility layers
for that matter.

## Procfile

If a **Procfile** is available in the source of your app, it will be used. See
the [dedicated Procfile page]({% post_url platform/app/2000-01-01-procfile %})
for more informations.

The Procfile `release` entry does not exist on Scalingo thus it won't be executed. The
[postdeploy hook]({% post_url platform/app/2000-01-01-postdeploy-hook %}) exists with similar functionnality. The difference is that the
*postdeploy* hook is only getting executed at the end of a successful
deployment, not at each change of variable/addon modification (creating a
release).

## Buildpacks

Most buildpacks and their functionalities work exactly the same as on Heroku.
Some buildpacks are written and maintained by our own. It's open source. Check
our [GitHub account](https://github.com/Scalingo/?query=buildpack) to see the
whole list.

## Environment variables

Because we'd like to conform as much as possible to the
[12-factor](http://12factor.net/) principle, you can configure your app through
[environment variables]({% post_url platform/app/2000-01-01-environment %})
which are injected into the context of your application.

## Realtime deployment

Based on a Git hook. Just git push your code!
