## List of error codes

Here is the list of error codes emitted by our routing layer:

* `499 Client Closed Request`: client closed the connection before the server answered the request.
  It is usually caused by client side timeout
* `502 Bad Gateway`: your application sent an invalid response to our reverse proxy. This error is
  often sent when your application is abruptly cutting connections.
* `503 Service Unavailable`:
  * The application [requests queue]({% post_url platform/internals/2000-01-01-routing
    %}#requests-queue) is full, so the newly incoming request has not been dequeued
  * The application has been stopped by its owner
  * The application has no `web` container responding to web requests
* `504 Gateway Timeout`: application behind the proxy timed out. Your application must accept
  connections and send the first byte in [a limited amount of time]({% post_url
  platform/internals/2000-01-01-routing %}#timeouts).
