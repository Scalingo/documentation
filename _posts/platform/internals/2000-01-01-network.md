Thousands of applications are hosted on Scalingo, they can be deployed, restarted or scaled at any
time. Each of these operations impacts the internal topology of our infrastructure. Traffic routers
handle the incoming requests and route them dynamically into the infrastructure.

## Reverse Proxy

Our infrastructure is composed of a multitude of servers running our customer's applications. These
servers are not reachable from the wild outside world, they are hidden behind some frontend servers
called reverse proxies. A reverse proxy is a HTTP server which receives requests and forwards them
to the application containers. Scalingo is powered using OpenResty reverse proxy. When a request is
received, the proxy looks at the targeted domain name thanks to the Host HTTP header for a simple
HTTP request or to the SNI extension in the case of a secured HTTPS connection. Once the domain name
is defined, the connection is forwarded to the container(s) of the application matching this domain
name. In a second time, the application container processes the request and sends the answer to the
client through the reverse proxy.

## Outgoing IP

All outgoing traffic from Scalingo application comes from the following range of IPs:

```
185.60.151.0/26
```

You may need this information if you want to reach private external services hidden behind a firewall. You may also be interested by our VPN addons: [Scalingo OpenVPN](https://scalingo.com/addons/scalingo-openvpn) and [Scalingo VPN IPSec](https://scalingo.com/addons/scalingo-vpn-ipsec).

## IPv6

Scalingo's infrastructure does not yet support IPv6 addressing. Our infrastructure provider is
working hard to add IPv6 support.
