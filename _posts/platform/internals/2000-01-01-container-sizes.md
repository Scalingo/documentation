## Container Limits

Containers have various limits depending on their size. Here is a comprehensive list:

- RAM: cf. above-mentioned table
- Swap: twice the amount of RAM.
- CPU access: high priority means twice as much priority compared to standard priority. For example,
  consider three containers, one has a high priority and two others have a standard priority. When
  processes in all three containers attempt to use 100% of CPU, the first container would receive
  50% of the total CPU time and the two others would receive 25%.
- PID limits: from 128 (S) to 2048 (2XL).
- Ulimit nofile: 10000. Maximum number of files an application can open.
