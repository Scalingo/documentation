We provide a command line tool (CLI) to interact with the platform. It uses our standard API.

## Supported operating systems

<ul class='list-inline mb-0'>
  {% for os in page.oses %}
    <li class='list-inline-item mr-3 my-3'>
      <div class="mdc-typography--title">
        <svg aria-hidden="true" role="img" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" viewBox="0 0 512 512">
          <use xlink:href="#{{ os | downcase }}"></use>
        </svg>
        {{ os }}
      </div>
    </li>
  {% endfor %}
</ul>

For each of these operating systems, you can download
[a precompiled binary](https://github.com/Scalingo/cli/releases).

The client is developed with Go. Therefore, there is no external dependency.

## Installation

### Linux & MacOS

You need to download the binary and put it in your `PATH`. The easiest way is
to copy/paste the command below in your terminal and execute it.

```bash
curl -O https://cli-dl.scalingo.io/install && bash install
```

### Windows

We highly recommend to use [git-bash](https://git-for-windows.github.io/) to have an all-in-one deployment environment.

Then, you need to download Scalingo command-line tool:

* [Windows 64 bits users](http://cli-dl.scalingo.io/release/scalingo_latest_windows_amd64.zip)
* [Windows 32 bits users](http://cli-dl.scalingo.io/release/scalingo_latest_windows_386.zip)

Place the `scalingo.exe` file in the path you want, e.g. "C:/Program Files".

From git-bash add this path to your `PATH` environment variable:

```bash
$ export PATH=$PATH:/c/Program\ Files/
```

Now you should be able to run `scalingo.exe` from git-bash.

Note that you set `PATH` for this specific git-bash instance and that you should add the command line above to a `.bashrc` file at the root of your `HOME`:

```bash
$ echo "export PATH=$PATH:/c/Program\ Files/" >> $HOME/.bashrc
```

Now `scalingo.exe` will be available from git-bash for your next sessions.

## Command Completion

### Bash

* Make sure bash completion is installed. If you use a current Linux in a
  non-minimal installation, bash completion should be available. On macOS,
  install with `brew install bash-completion`

* Get bash completion script in the directory:
  * Linux users `/etc/bash_completion.d/`:

  ```bash
    sudo curl "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Scalingo/cli/master/cmd/autocomplete/scripts/scalingo_complete.bash" -o /etc/bash_completion.d/scalingo_complete.sh
  ```

  * macOS users `/usr/local/etc/bash_completion.d/`:

  ```bash
    sudo curl "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Scalingo/cli/master/cmd/autocomplete/scripts/scalingo_complete.bash" -o /usr/local/etc/bash_completion.d/scalingo_complete.sh
  ```

* Reload your shell in order to make the completion available:

  ```bash
  exec bash -l
  ```

### Zsh

* Create a directory `~/.zsh/completion/` :

  ```bash
  mkdir -p ~/.zsh/completion
  ```

* Get Zsh completion script in the directory `~/.zsh/completion/` :

  ```bash
  curl "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Scalingo/cli/master/cmd/autocomplete/scripts/scalingo_complete.zsh" > ~/.zsh/completion/scalingo_complete.zsh
  ```

* Make sure the completion script will be loaded, by adding to the following line to your `~/.zshrc` :

  ```bash
  source ~/.zsh/completion/scalingo_complete.zsh
  ```

* Reload your shell:

  ```bash
  exec zsh -l
  ```
