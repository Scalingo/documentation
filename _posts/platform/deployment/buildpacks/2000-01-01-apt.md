## Purpose of this buildpack

The environment used to build and run applications, based on Ubuntu, is
embedding a wide set of libraries and binaries. However it is possible that
your application requires one or multiple dependencies which are not present by
default. The [APT buildpack](https://github.com/Scalingo/apt-buildpack) aims at
installing additional packages using the `apt` package manager.

Details about the default environment can be found on the following page:
[Scalingo Builder - Our base Docker image]({% post_url
platform/internals/2000-01-01-base-docker-image %})

## Set up this buildpack for your application

This buildpack is designed to be used in conjunction with one or more additional
buildpacks, thanks to the [multi buildpack]({% post_url platform/deployment/buildpacks/2000-01-01-multi %}).

When creating a new Scalingo app:

```console
$ scalingo create my-app
$ scalingo env-set BUILDPACK_URL=https://github.com/Scalingo/multi-buildpack.git

$ cat << EOF > .buildpacks
https://github.com/Scalingo/apt-buildpack.git
https://github.com/Scalingo/ruby-buildpack.git
EOF
```

The above commands configure your application to use the multi buildpack, and
define the `.buildpacks` file. This file configures the different buildpacks to
apply. In this example, we configure the APT and the Ruby buildpack.

## Configuration

Once the buildpack is configured for your app, the packages to install have to
be defined in a file named `Aptfile` which should be located at the root of the
application.

It can contain three types of information:

* A package name present in the Ubuntu repository

```
popplers-utils
```

* An URL to a `.deb` package which will be downloaded and installed

```
http://downloads.sourceforge.net/project/wkhtmltopdf/0.12.1/wkhtmltox-0.12.1_linux-trusty-amd64.deb
```

* A `:repo:deb` instruction to add an APT repository to download packages from

```
:repo:deb http://cz.archive.ubuntu.com/ubuntu artful main universe
```

<aside class="warning" markdown="1">
Current base image is based on **Ubuntu 14:04 Trusty**, you have to make sure
the chosen packages are compatible with this release.
</aside>

Of course, the three types of value can be combined, example:

```
popplers-utils
http://downloads.sourceforge.net/project/wkhtmltopdf/0.12.1/wkhtmltox-0.12.1_linux-trusty-amd64.deb
:repo:deb http://cz.archive.ubuntu.com/ubuntu artful main universe
```

## Output

At the next deployment, the APT buildpack should be doing its job (example with `popplers-utils` package):
