## Purpose of this buildpack

You may need to combine several technologies in your project, this buildpack is here to fulfill this need.

## Set up this buildpack for your application

By setting the configuration variable `BUILDPACK_URL`, the Scalingo's deployment stack will
automatically fetch the given buildpack to deploy your application.

```bash
scalingo env-set BUILDPACK_URL=https://github.com/Scalingo/multi-buildpack.git
```

## Choice of the buildpacks to use

Create a file named `.buildpacks` in your project which will define the buildpacks to use:

```bash
https://github.com/Scalingo/nodejs-buildpack.git
https://github.com/Scalingo/go-buildpack.git
```

Add this file to your git repository:

```bash
git add .buildpacks
git commit -m "Setup .buildpacks for using multiple buildpacks on Scalingo"
```

Finally in this example, thanks to this method, both Node.js buildpack and Go buildpack will be applied
on your project.

### Can I checkout a custom buildpack branch?

Yes.

You have to use the syntax `URL#branchname` in your `.buildpacks` file:

```
https://github.com/Scalingo/java-buildpack#javaonly
```

### Does the buildpack order matter?

Yes.

The multi buildpacks tries to detect the way to start your application from the
last buildpack you are installing. As a result, if your application is a **Node.js**
application and you need to run the **Java** buildpack to install a custom JDK.
You need to have the **Node.js** buildpack last:

```
https://github.com/Scalingo/java-buildpack#javaonly
https://github.com/Scalingo/nodejs-buildpack
```

Without doing that, if you don't have a [Procfile]({% post_url platform/app/2000-01-01-procfile %}), your application will fail to boot.

## Deploy your application

```bash
git push scalingo master
```
