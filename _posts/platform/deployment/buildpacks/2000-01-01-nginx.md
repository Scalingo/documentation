## Purpose of this buildpack

Looking for a reverse proxy or an API gateway for your apps? This buildpack might be the solution
you are looking for. The [Nginx buildpack](https://github.com/Scalingo/nginx-buildpack) lets you
specify custom Nginx configuration. With this buildpack, you can provide a Nginx configuration file
with the rules you want to set.

## Set up this buildpack

This buildpack is designed to be used in conjunction with one or more additional
buildpacks, thanks to the [multi buildpack]({% post_url
platform/deployment/buildpacks/2000-01-01-multi %}).

For instance, using the Scalingo CLI:

```console
$ scalingo create my-app
$ scalingo env-set BUILDPACK_URL=https://github.com/Scalingo/nginx-buildpack.git
```

## Configuration

The buildpack is expecting a configuration file at the root of the project which can be:

- `nginx.conf`: configuration file
- `nginx.conf.erb`: template to generate the configuration file

If the template is found, it will be rendered as configuration file, it let you use environment
variables as in the following examples.

### Specify Nginx Version

By default we're installing the latest available version of Nginx, but if you want to use a specific
version, you can define the environment variable `NGINX_VERSION`:

```console
$ scalingo env-set NGINX_VERSION=1.8.0
```

### Discouraged Directives

The following directives should not be used in you configuration file:
`listen`, `access_log`, `error_log` and `server_name`.

### Configuration Examples

Split traffic to 2 APIs

```nginx
location /api/v1 {
  proxy_pass <%= ENV["API_V1_BACKEND"] %>;
}

location /api/v2 {
  proxy_pass <%= ENV["API_V2_BACKEND"] %>;
}
```

Use nginx configuration: [nginx.org/en/docs](https://nginx.org/en/docs) to get
details about how to configure your app.

## Output

The application deployment output will look like:

```text
-----> Cloning custom buildpack: https://github.com/Scalingo/nginx-buildpack.git#master
-----> Bundling NGINX 1.10.1
```

## Advanced Informations

The configuration file you have to provide is at the `server` level, if you
need to add something at the `http` level, please open an
[issue](https://github.com/Scalingo/nginx-buildpack/issues/new) or a pull
request and we'll discuss it.
