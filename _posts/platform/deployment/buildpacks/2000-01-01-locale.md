## Purpose of this buildpack

The environment used to build and run applications, based on Ubuntu, only
includes the English language pack. You may still want to use a custom language
pack. The [locale buildpack](https://github.com/Scalingo/locale-buildpack) aims
at installing additional language packs.

Details about the default environment can be found on the following page:
[Scalingo Builder - Our base Docker image]({% post_url
platform/internals/2000-01-01-base-docker-image %})

## Set up this buildpack for your application

This buildpack is designed to be used in conjunction with one or more additional
buildpacks, thanks to the [multi buildpack]({% post_url
platform/deployment/buildpacks/2000-01-01-multi %}).

For instance, when creating a new Ruby app on Scalingo:

```console
$ scalingo create my-app
$ scalingo env-set BUILDPACK_URL=https://github.com/Scalingo/multi-buildpack.git

$ cat << EOF > .buildpacks
https://github.com/Scalingo/locale-buildpack.git
https://github.com/Scalingo/ruby-buildpack.git
EOF
```

The above commands configure your application to use the multi buildpack, and
define the `.buildpacks` file. This file configures the different buildpacks to
apply. In this example, we configure the locale and the Ruby buildpack.

## Configuration

Once the buildpack is configured for your app, the language pack to install have to
be defined in a file named `.locales` which should be located at the root of the
application.

This file contains one locale per line. For instance, to add German and French
language pack, this file must contain:

```text
de_DE
fr_FR
```

Commit that file and trigger a new build. The specified locales will be
installed by the buildpack.

## Output

At the next deployment, the locale buildpack will install the required language
packs:
