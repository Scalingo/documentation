## Deployment Environment

All the deployments on the platform are executed in isolated containers with
the following specification:

* 6 CPUs
* 8 GB RAM
* 4 GB of Swap

## Limits

The following limits are applied to each deployment:

* Maximum duration: 30 minutes
* Maximum size of the application image: 1024MB

## Raising any parameters

We believe that most deployments should be fine in the previously described
settings and limits. However all these attributes are not hard barriers. It
means that if you need any of those parameters to get higher for a specific
need, feel free to contact the support, they would help you achieving your
deployment the right way.
