To setup **Continuous Deployment** from Codeship to Scalingo, please follow the
following steps. You can read more about [Deployment
Pipelines](https://codeship.com/documentation/continuous-deployment/deployment-pipelines/)
on the Codeship documentation.

### Setup a Deployment Pipeline

On Codeship:

1. Go to the **Deployment** page of your project.
2. Add a new deployment pipeline by choosing the branch you want to deploy from.
3. Choose **Custom Script** deployment type.
4. Fill the deployment commands:

```bash
git fetch --unshallow || true
git push --force ssh://git@ssh.osc-fr1.scalingo.com:2200/my-app.git ${CI_COMMIT_ID}:master
```

Note that the remote URL depends on the region of your application. You can get
it using our CLI with:

```bash
scalingo --app my-app git-show
```

Or you can use the
[deployments/git_push.sh](https://github.com/codeship/scripts/blob/master/deployments/git_push.sh)
script provided by Codeship.

### SSH Keys

To deploy to Scalingo from Codeship, you'll have to add the public key generated by Codeship to the [SSH Keys page](https://my.scalingo.com/keys) on Scalingo dashboard. You can find this public key in the **General** page of your Codeship project.
