To setup **Continuous Deployment** from Semaphore to Scalingo, please follow
the [official
guide](https://semaphoreci.com/docs/deploying-with-git-deploy.html) which will
take you through the mandatory steps. This documentation page adds some information for the step 3 **Write your deploy commands** of the Semaphore guide.

### Setup Deploy Commands

```bash
# Add Scalingo as a known host
ssh-keyscan -H -p 22 scalingo.com >> ~/.ssh/known_hosts

# Push the branch you've setup on Semaphore
git push --force git@scalingo.com:my-app.git $BRANCH_NAME:master
```

### SSH Keys

To deploy to Scalingo from Semaphore, you'll have to add your private key to the Semaphore interface. You will also need to add the public key to the [SSH Keys page](https://my.scalingo.com/keys) on Scalingo dashboard.

We recommend to generate a new key pair for integrating Semaphore with Scalingo.
