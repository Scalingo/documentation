To make your builds faster, Scalingo uses a cache named the Deployment cache.
Depending on your technology, many different things might go into this cache.

For example, in Node.js, we cache the `.node_modules` directory. This cache will be used during the next deployment instead of downloading the entire dependency tree.

{% note %}
Protip: If you are a buildpack developer, you can store things in this cache by moving files into the `CACHE_DIR` folder passed as the second argument of the `bin/compile` script.
{% endnote %}

## Clearing your deployment cache

If you suspect that a build problem is being caused by an error in this cache, you can use our CLI tool to clear it:

```
scalingo --app my-app deployment-delete-cache
```
