PostgreSQL is the official addon provided by Scalingo, details on the available plans can be found [here](https://scalingo.com/databases/postgresql). This addon gives your app instant access to a PostgreSQL database running in its own Docker container.

## Adding PostgreSQL to your app

You can add the PostgreSQL addon through the **dashboard** or through the **command line interface**. The capacity of your database is elastic, you will be able to upgrade it later.

### Through the Dashboard

1. Go to your app on [Scalingo Dashboard](https://my.scalingo.com/apps)
2. Click on **Addons** tab
3. Select the addon you want to add
4. In the dialog select the database plan you need
5. Validate your choice

{% assign img_url = "https://cdn.scalingo.com/documentation/screenshot_dashboard_addons_postgresql.png" %}
{% include mdl_img.html %}

### Through the command-line interface

```bash
$ scalingo --app my-app addons-add postgresql 1g

-----> Addon postgresql has been provisionned
       ID: my-app-3030
       Modified variables: [DATABASE_URL SCALINGO_POSTGRESQL_URL]
       Message from addon provider: Database successfully created
```

This command will provision the application `my-app` with a `1g` PostgreSQL
database plan.

To find out what other plans are available:

```bash
$ scalingo addons-plans postgresql
```

## PostgreSQL Cluster Setup

If using a Business plan for your PostgreSQL addon, we setup a PostgreSQL
cluster. This cluster has the following configuration:

- multiple PostgreSQL nodes in a private network: the amount of memory per node
  depends on the plan,
- a couple of HAProxy as entrypoint to your cluster private network: one is the
  leader and the other is just here as a backup in case of failing leader.

The communication between the PostgreSQL nodes is encrypted.

## Getting your connection URI

Once the addon is provisioned, 2 environment variables are added to your app:
`SCALINGO_POSTGRESQL_URL` and `DATABASE_URL`. `DATABASE_URL` is an alias to
`SCALINGO_POSTGRESQL_URL`. To find out how to use it in your code please refer
to [Application environment]({% post_url platform/app/2000-01-01-environment
%}).

In most cases, you can pass the variable directly to the client library you are
using in your code. But sometimes the library requires a specific URI format,
you'll need to add a little bit of code to suit the library.

You can get environment variables from the dashboard or the command line interface.

### From the Dashboard

1. Go to your app on [Scalingo Dashboard](https://my.scalingo.com/apps)
2. Click on **Environment** tab
3. `SCALINGO_POSTGRESQL_URL` is displayed

{% assign img_url = "https://cdn.scalingo.com/documentation/screenshot_dashboard_environment_postgresql.png" %}
{% include mdl_img.html %}

### From the command-line interface

```bash
$ scalingo --app my-app env | grep POSTGRESQL

DATABASE_URL=$SCALINGO_POSTGRESQL_URL
SCALINGO_POSTGRESQL_URL=postgres://example_app_3030:ptojfrxzRi-lDfDYyahe@my-app-3030.postgresql.dbs.appsdeck.eu:31000/example_app_3030
```

## Remote access your database

If you need to access your database from other places than your app please
follow the [Access your database]({% post_url
platform/databases/2000-01-01-access %}) guide.

### Force TLS connections

PostgreSQL [support
TLS](https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/static/ssl-tcp.html) to
encrypt all of its network traffic between the client and the
server.

By default, all new PostgreSQL databases have TLS activated. If you want to
connect to it, you have nothing to do. `psql` will automatically first try to
connect using TLS, and if it fails will try without TLS. `psql` will display an
informative message if you succeed to connect using TLS:

```shell
> psql "<connection string>"
psql (9.6.5)
SSL connection (protocol: TLSv1.2, cipher: ECDHE-RSA-AES256-GCM-SHA384, bits: 256, compression: off)
Type "help" for help.

dbname_6246=#
```

Some existing databases may not have yet TLS support. To activate TLS, you need
to restart the database.  Any action leading to the restart will activate TLS
(e.g. plan update, upgrade of the database).

TLS is an option, you can still access your database without it if needed.

If you want to force connections to your database to use TLS, head to the
database dashboard and click on the toggle button:

{% assign img_url = "https://cdn.scalingo.com/documentation/screenshot_database_mongo_force_tls.png" %}
{% include mdl_img.html %}

Note that you must have configured your application to use TLS when connecting
to the database.

## Changing plans

You can upgrade or downgrade your database plan whenever you need it. This
operation happens instantly thanks to Docker containers and no manual input is
required. When you change the plan, your database will be stopped then
restarted on a new host with new parameters of the chosen plan. During the
operation the connection is dropped between your app and the database. Finally,
after the operation is successful, the related app will be restarted.

### From the Dashboard

1. Go to your app on [Scalingo Dashboard](https://my.scalingo.com/apps)
2. Click on **Addons** tab
3. Select the addon you want to change
4. In the dialog select the plan you want to upgrade/downgrade to
5. Validate your choice

### From the command-line interface

To upgrade or downgrade your addon the sub-command is the same: `addons-upgrade`.

```bash
$ scalingo --app my-app addons-upgrade my-app-3030 2g
```

In this example, `my-app-3030` is the ID of the addon, and `2g` is the plan we
want to upgrade to.

To find out the addon ID:

```bash
$ scalingo --app my-app addons

+---------------------+------------------+------+
|        ADDON        |        ID        | PLAN |
+---------------------+------------------+------+
| PostgreSQL | my-app-3030      |   1g |
+---------------------+------------------+------+
```

## Database dashboard

The PostgreSQL dashboard is the central place for administrative tasks such as:

- Monitor database and system stats
- Upgrade the database engine version
- Activate database specific features
- Manage database users
- Manage backups

{% assign img_url = "https://cdn.scalingo.com/documentation/screenshot_database_postgresql_overview.png" %}
{% include mdl_img.html %}

### Database Upgrade

When the database vendor releases a new version of your database engine, we will
try to provide it as soon as possible. You will have the choice to upgrade your
database with one click through your database dashboard.

This operation is similar to changing your database plan; your database will be
stopped and restarted with the new database version. Thanks to Docker containers
this happens seamlessly and quickly without manual action. When this operation
finishes, your application will be restarted.

{% warning %}
Beware that no downgrade is possible once your database has been upgraded.

### Container Stats

<table class="mdl-data-table ">
  <tbody>
    <tr>
      <td class="mdl-data-table__cell--non-numeric">CPU usage</td>
      <td class="mdl-data-table__cell--non-numeric">Current CPU usage.</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td class="mdl-data-table__cell--non-numeric">Memory usage</td>
      <td class="mdl-data-table__cell--non-numeric">Display the current, hightest and free memory. Highest is the maximum memory recorded since database restarted.</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td class="mdl-data-table__cell--non-numeric">Swap usage</td>
      <td class="mdl-data-table__cell--non-numeric">Display the current, hightest and free swap. Highest is the maximum swap recorded since database restarted.</td>
    </tr>
  </tbody>
</table>

### Database Stats

<table class="mdl-data-table ">
  <tbody>
    <tr>
      <td class="mdl-data-table__cell--non-numeric">Database connections</td>
      <td class="mdl-data-table__cell--non-numeric">Number of currently open and maximum connections.</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td class="mdl-data-table__cell--non-numeric">Data size</td>
      <td class="mdl-data-table__cell--non-numeric">Logical space reported by the database.</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>

      <td class="mdl-data-table__cell--non-numeric">Effective physical space used.</td>
    </tr>
  </tbody>
</table>

### Database Users

By default, Scalingo creates a read and write user on your database with the
following rights:

```sql
GRANT CREATE ON SCHEMA public TO <username>
GRANT ALL PRIVILEGES ON DATABASE <database> TO <username>
GRANT ALL PRIVILEGES ON ALL TABLES IN SCHEMA public TO <username>
GRANT ALL PRIVILEGES ON ALL SEQUENCES IN SCHEMA public TO <username>
ALTER DEFAULT PRIVILEGES FOR USER <database> IN SCHEMA public GRANT ALL ON TABLES TO <username>
ALTER DEFAULT PRIVILEGES FOR USER <database> IN SCHEMA public GRANT ALL ON SEQUENCES TO <username>
```

If you create a new user using the web dashboard, it will get the same rights.

You can also generate a read only user with the following rights:

```sql
GRANT USAGE ON SCHEMA public TO <username>
GRANT CONNECT ON DATABASE <database> TO <username>
GRANT SELECT ON ALL TABLES IN SCHEMA public TO <username>
GRANT SELECT ON ALL SEQUENCES IN SCHEMA public TO <username>
ALTER DEFAULT PRIVILEGES FOR USER <database> IN SCHEMA public GRANT SELECT ON TABLES TO <username>
ALTER DEFAULT PRIVILEGES FOR USER <database> IN SCHEMA public GRANT SELECT ON SEQUENCES TO <username>
```

## Backups

TODO Update the screenshot once the DB dashboard PR is merged

{% include database_backups.md %}

Scalingo PostgreSQL databases offer two way of backing up the data.

### Point-in-Time Recovery

Point-in-Time Recovery (PITR) allows you to ask for the restoration of your data
at a specific date. We achieve this by making a full snapshot of the database
weekly. Between two snapshots, we keep track of the write-ahead logs (WAL). The
WAL contains all the modification instructions. By replaying the WAL from a
snapshot to a specific date, we are able to rebuild the state of the database at
that date.

### On-demand Backups

You can ask the platform for a backup which will be performed on the follower node
(if on a Business plan, on the main node otherwise)
using the standard tool `pg_dump`.
It makes a full backup of your database and outputs a series of SQL commands
you can execute to get a copy of the database at the state when the backup
was done.

On-demand backups can be **automated on a daily basis**. You can specify your
preferred time of the day when the action will be triggered. These backups are
limited in total number and maximum number per day. For example, if your plan
allows for 15 backups total and you already have asked for 15 on-demand backups,
the next time you'll ask for one, your oldest on-demand backup will be deleted.

#### Download automated backups

Automated backups are listed in the database specific dashboard.
