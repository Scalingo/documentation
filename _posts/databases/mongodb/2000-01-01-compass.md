MongoDB Compass is the official GUI to manage MongoDB database. It supports CRUD operations and
offers nice visualization of your data. It is freely available on the [MongoDB
website](https://www.mongodb.com/products/compass).

Databases hosted on Scalingo are not by default directly available on the Internet. To access it, a
solution is to setup an [encrypted tunnel]({% post_url platform/databases/2000-01-01-access %}).

MongoDB Compass lets you configure this tunnel. We will guide through the steps to configure
the connection to a Scalingo hosted MongoDB through an encrypted tunnel.

## Configuration of Compass

The connection data can be found in the `MONGO_URL` environment variable of your application.

```
$ scalingo env | grep MONGO_URL
MONGO_URL=mongodb://sample-node-meanjs-7093:EsEjseivpacatVoogfijbiapgadTyg@c393a9e3-42fe-4e33-9e6c-8ee815e9af88.sample-node-meanjs-7093.mongodb.dbs.scalingo.com:31312/sample-node-meanjs-7093
```

In this case:

* Hostname: c393a9e3-42fe-4e33-9e6c-8ee815e9af88.sample-node-meanjs-7093.mongodb.dbs.scalingo.com
* Port: 31312
* User: sample-node-meanjs-7093
* Password: EsEjseivpacatVoogfijbiapgadTyg
* Database: sample-node-meanjs-7093

Fill the fields accordingly:

{% assign width = "450px" %}
{% assign img_url = "https://cdn.scalingo.com/documentation/compass/new_connection.png" %}
{% include mdl_img.html %}

The "SSH Tunnel" section must "Use Identity File". The identity file to provide is your private SSH
key you uploaded on your Scalingo profile.

### Connect with TLS

As a replacement to using an encrypted tunnel to connect to your database, you can make it available
on the internet from your database dashboard. You must first [force
TLS]({% post_url databases/mongodb/2000-01-01-start %}#force-tls-connections) connections.

This is done in Compass by selecting "Server Validation" in the "SSL" section of the "Connect to
Host" form:

{% assign img_url = "https://cdn.scalingo.com/documentation/compass/ssl_configuration.png" %}
{% include mdl_img.html %}

The "Certificate Authority" is downloadable
[here](https://db-api.scalingo.com/api/ca_certificate).
