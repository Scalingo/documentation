MySQL is the official addon provided by Scalingo, details on the available plans can be found [here](https://scalingo.com/databases/mysql). This addon gives your app instant access to a MySQL database running in its own Docker container.


## Adding MySQL to your app

You can add the MySQL addon through the dashboard or through the command line interface. The capacity of your database is elastic, you will be able to upgrade it later.

### Through the Dashboard

1. Go to your app on [Scalingo Dashboard](https://my.scalingo.com/apps)
2. Click on **Addons** tab
3. Select the addon you want to add
4. In the dialog select the database plan you need
5. Validate your choice

{% assign img_url = "https://cdn.scalingo.com/documentation/screenshot_dashboard_addons_mysql.png" %}
{% include mdl_img.html %}

### Through the command-line interface

```bash
$ scalingo --app my-app addons-add mysql 1g

-----> Addon mysql has been provisionned
       ID: my-app-3030
       Modified variables: [DATABASE_URL SCALINGO_MYSQL_URL]
       Message from addon provider: Database successfully created
```

This command will provision the application `my-app` with a `1g` MySQL database plan.

To find out what other plans are available:

```bash
$ scalingo addons-plans mysql
```

## Getting your connection URI

Once the addon is provisioned, 2 environment variables are added to your app: `SCALINGO_MYSQL_URL` and `DATABASE_URL`. To find out how to use it in your code please refer to [Application environment]({% post_url platform/app/2000-01-01-environment %}).

In most cases, you can pass the variable directly to the client library you are using in your code. But sometimes the library requires a specific URI format, you'll need to add a little bit of code to suit the library.

You can get environment variables from the dashboard or the command line interface.

### From the Dashboard

1. Go to your app on [Scalingo Dashboard](https://my.scalingo.com/apps)
2. Click on **Environment** tab
3. `SCALINGO_MYSQL_URL` is displayed

{% assign img_url = "https://cdn.scalingo.com/documentation/screenshot_dashboard_environment_mysql.png" %}
{% include mdl_img.html %}

### From the command-line interface

```bash
$ scalingo --app my-app env | grep MYSQL

DATABASE_URL=$SCALINGO_MYSQL_URL
SCALINGO_MYSQL_URL=mysql://my_app_3030:CaUrq1MdUkAzCSEq-1Fg@my-app-3030.mysql.dbs.appsdeck.eu:30999/my_app_3030
```

### Ruby on Rails specific

`DATABASE_URL` is an alias to `SCALINGO_MYSQL_URL`, the Ruby buildpack will read the value of `DATABASE_URL` and create the `database.yml` configuration file accordingly.

If youre using the <em>mysql2</em> gem, you will need to copy the value of `SCALINGO_MYSQL_URL` into `DATABASE_URL` and change the scheme part from `mysql://` to `mysql2://`.


## Remote access your database

If you need to access your database from other places than your app please follow the [Access your database]({% post_url platform/databases/2000-01-01-access %}) guide.

### Force TLS connections

MySQL [support
TLS](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/5.7/en/encrypted-connections.html) to
encrypt all of its network traffic between the client and the
server.

By default, all new MySQL databases have TLS activated. If you want to connect
to it, you have nothing to do. The `mysql` client will automatically first try
to connect using TLS, and if it fails will try without TLS. If you want to
ensure it connects using TLS, you can use the `--ssl-mode` option:

```shell
mysql --ssl-mode REQUIRED -u <user> --password=<password> -h <host> -P <port> dbname
```

Some existing databases may not have yet TLS support. To activate TLS, you need
to restart the database.  Any action leading to the restart will activate TLS
(e.g. plan update, upgrade of the database).

TLS is an option, you can still access your database without it if needed.

If you want to force connections to your database to use TLS, head to the
database dashboard and click on the toggle button:

{% assign img_url = "https://cdn.scalingo.com/documentation/screenshot_database_mongo_force_tls.png" %}
{% include mdl_img.html %}

Note that you must have configured your application to use TLS when connecting
to the database.

Some providers like Google DataStudio will require a client certificate when TLS is enabled. In this case, contact us via the in app chat, or at support@scalingo.com.

## Changing plans

You can upgrade or downgrade your database plan whenever you need it. This
operation happens instantly thanks to Docker containers and no manual input is
required. When you change the plan, your database will be stopped then
restarted on a new host with new parameters of the chosen plan. During the
operation the connection is dropped between your app and the database. Finally,
after the operation is successful, the related app will be restarted.

### From the Dashboard

1. Go to your app on [Scalingo Dashboard](https://my.scalingo.com/apps)
2. Click on **Addons** tab
3. Select the addon you want to change
4. In the dialog select the plan you want to upgrade/downgrade to
5. Validate your choice

### From the command-line interface

To upgrade or downgrade your addon the sub-command is the same: `addons-upgrade`.

```bash
$ scalingo --app my-app addons-upgrade my-app-3030 2g
```

In this example, `my-app-3030` is the ID of the addon, and `2g` is the plan we want to upgrade to.

To find out the addon ID:

```bash
$ scalingo --app my-app addons

+----------------+------------------+------+
|      ADDON     |        ID        | PLAN |
+----------------+------------------+------+
| MySQL | my-app-3030      |   1g |
+----------------+------------------+------+
```

## Database dashboard

The MySQL dashboard is the central place for administrative tasks such as:

- Monitor database and system stats
- Upgrade the database engine version
- Activate database specific features
- Manage database users
- Manage backups

{% assign img_url = "https://cdn.scalingo.com/documentation/screenshot_database_mysql_overview.png" %}
{% include mdl_img.html %}

### Database Upgrade

When the database vendor releases a new version of your database engine, we will try to provide it as soon as possible. You will have the choice to upgrade your database with one click through your database dashboard.

This operation is similar to changing your database plan; your database will be stopped and
restarted with the new database version. When this operation finishes, your application will be
restarted.

{% warning %}
Beware that no downgrade is possible once your database has been upgraded.
