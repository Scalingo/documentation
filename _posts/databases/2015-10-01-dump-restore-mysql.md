There's two ways to dump a distant database and restore the data in your Scalingo database. The first one involves dumping the data on your local workstation and the second one involves doing the same operations from within a Scalingo one-off container (see [application tasks]({% post_url app/2014-10-02-tasks %})).

## Dump and Restore from your local workstation

You can dump and restore your database from your local workstation using [Scalingo CLI]({% post_url cli/2015-09-18-command-line-tool %}) to [create a tunnel]({% post_url databases/2014-11-24-tunnel %}) to your database:

A MySQL URL is usually formatted like: <br>
`mysql://<username>:<password>@<host>:<port>/<db>`

To get the URL of your database, go to the 'Environment' part of your dashboard or
run the following command:

```bash
$ scalingo -a myapp env | grep MYSQL
```

If your remote database URL is:

```bash
mysql://user:pass@my-db.mysql.dbs.com:30000/my-db
```

### Setup the tunnel

```bash
$ scalingo -a myapp db-tunnel SCALINGO_MYSQL_URL
scalingo -a myapp db-tunnel SCALINGO_MYSQL_URL
Building tunnel to my-db.mysql.dbs.scalingo.eu:30000
You can access your database on '127.0.0.1:10000'
```

### Dump

The command definition is:
```bash
$ mysqldump -u <username> --password=<password> -h <host> -P <port> <db> > dump.sql
```

Applied to our example:

```bash
$ mysqldump -u my-db --password=pass -h 127.0.0.1 -P 10000 my-db > /tmp/dumped_db.sql
```

As you can see we're using the host and port provided by the tunnel, not those of the URL

### Restore

The command definition is:
```bash
$ mysql -u <username> --password=<password> -h <host> -P <port> <db> < dump.sql
```

With our example:
```bash
$ mysql -u my-db --password=pass -h 127.0.0.1 -P 10000 my-db < /tmp/dumped_db.sql
```

## Dump and Restore from Scalingo one-off container

You can dump and restore your database remotely using
[the command-line-tool]({% post_url cli/2015-09-18-command-line-tool %})
and a one-off container (see [application tasks]({% post_url app/2014-10-02-tasks %})).
The advantage of this method is the network.
From your workstation you donâ€™t always have a good bandwidth. From our infrastructure,
data transfers will be way faster.

### Dump & Restore

```bash
$ scalingo -a myapp run bash

[00:00] Scalingo ~ $ mysqldump -u user --password=pass -h my-db.mysql.dbs.scalingo.com -P 30000 my-db > /tmp/dumped_db.sql
...

# Do something with the dump, i.e.e send through FTP or to an external server

[00:00] Scalingo ~ $ mysql -u my-db --password=pass -h my-db.mysql.dbs.scalingo.com -P 30000 my-db < /tmp/dumped_db.sql
...
[00:00] Scalingo ~ $ exit
exit
```

After exiting the one-off container, the dump will be lost, you've to do something with it in the container.
