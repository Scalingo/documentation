Scalingo Redis addon is the official addon provided by Scalingo, details on the available plans can be found [here](https://scalingo.com/addons/scalingo-redis). This addon gives your app instant access to a Redis database running in its own Docker container.


## Adding Scalingo Redis addon to your app

You can add the Redis addon through the dashboard or through the command line interface. The capacity of your database is elastic, you will be able to upgrade it later.

### Through the Dashboard

1. Go to your app on [Scalingo Dashboard](https://my.scalingo.com/apps)
2. Click on **Addons** tab
3. Select the addon you want to add
4. In the dialog select the database plan you need
5. Validate your choice

{% assign img_url = "https://cdn.scalingo.com/documentation/screenshot_dashboard_addons_redis.png" %}
{% include mdl_img.html %}

### Through the command-line interface

```bash
$ scalingo --app my-app addons-add scalingo-redis 1g

-----> Addon scalingo-redis has been provisionned
       ID: my-app-3030
       Modified variables: [REDIS_URL SCALINGO_REDIS_URL]
       Message from addon provider: Database successfully created
```

This command will provision the application `my-app` with a `1g` Redis database plan.

To find out what other plans are available:

```bash
$ scalingo addons-plans scalingo-redis
```


## Getting your connection URI

Once the addon is provisioned, 2 environment variables are added to your app: `SCALINGO_REDIS_URL` and `REDIS_URL`. `REDIS_URL` is an alias to `SCALINGO_REDIS_URL` for the convenience of some libraries such as the Ruby gem [sidekiq](http://sidekiq.org/), but using `SCALINGO_REDIS_URL` is preferred in most cases. To find out how to use it in your code please refer to [Application environment]({% post_url app/2014-09-15-environment %}).

In most cases, you can pass the variable directly to the client library you are using in your code. But sometimes the library requires a specific URI format, you'll need to add a little bit of code to suit the library.

You can get environment variables from the dashboard or the command line interface.

### From the Dashboard

1. Go to your app on [Scalingo Dashboard](https://my.scalingo.com/apps)
2. Click on **Environment** tab
3. `SCALINGO_REDIS_URL` is displayed

{% assign img_url = "https://cdn.scalingo.com/documentation/screenshot_dashboard_environment_redis.png" %}
{% include mdl_img.html %}

### From the command-line interface

```bash
$ scalingo --app my-app env | grep REDIS

REDIS_URL=$SCALINGO_REDIS_URL
SCALINGO_REDIS_URL=redis://my-app-3030:l2ebPNwe-IWVJmV8OlLX@my-app-3030.redis.dbs.appsdeck.eu:30996
```

## Remote access your database

If you need to access your database from other places than your app please follow the [Access your database]({% post_url databases/2015-06-24-access-database %}) guide.

## Redis configuration

### Number of databases

Each Redis instance can use 6 databases (numbered from 0, the default DB, to 5)

### Idle connections timeout

Redis configuration:

```
timeout 150
```

It means that if a connection has not been used during 150 seconds, it will be automatically closed by Redis. This is done to avoid accumulating staled connections. If your application is using a pool of connection to connect to the Redis database. This value has to been used for its configuration.

### Asynchronous disk save

Redis does not write all the operations requested by users on disk instantly, the write operations are done asynchronously by following different rules. Those used on the platform are defined here:

```
# Save to disk every 15 minutes if at least 1 operation has been done
save 900 1
# Save to disk every 5 minutes if at least 10 operations have been done
save 300 10
# Save to disk every minute if at least 10,000 operations have been done
save 60 10000
```

## Changing plans

You can upgrade or downgrade your database plan whenever you need it. This operation happens instantly thanks to Docker containers and no manual input is required. When you change the plan, your database will be stopped then simply restarted on a new host with new parameters of the chosen plan. During the operation the connection is dropped between your app and the database. Finally, after the operation is successful, the related app will be restarted.

### From the Dashboard

1. Go to your app on [Scalingo Dashboard](https://my.scalingo.com/apps)
2. Click on **Addons** tab
3. Select the addon you want to change
4. In the dialog select the plan you want to upgrade/downgrade to
5. Validate your choice

### From the command-line interface

To upgrade or downgrade your addon the sub-command is the same: `addons-upgrade`.

```bash
$ scalingo --app my-app addons-upgrade my-app-3030 2g
```

In this example, `my-app-3030` is the ID of the addon, and `2g` is the plan we want to upgrade to.

To find out the addon ID:

```bash
$ scalingo --app my-app addons

+----------------+------------------+------+
|      ADDON     |        ID        | PLAN |
+----------------+------------------+------+
| Scalingo Redis | my-app-3030      |   1g |
+----------------+------------------+------+
```

## Database dashboard

The Scalingo Redis dashboard is the central place for administrative tasks such as:

- Monitor database and system stats
- Upgrade the database engine version
- Activate database specific features
- Manage database users
- Manage backups

{% include mdl_img.html %}

### Database Upgrade

When the database vendor releases a new version of your database engine, we will try to provide it as soon as possible. You will have the choice to upgrade your database with just one click through your database dashboard.

This operation is similar to changing your database plan; your database will be stopped and restarted with new database environment. Thanks to Docker containers this happens seamlessly and quickly without manual action. When this operation finishes, your application will be restarted.

    <tr>
      <td class="mdl-data-table__cell--non-numeric">CPU usage</td>
      <td class="mdl-data-table__cell--non-numeric">Current CPU usage.</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td class="mdl-data-table__cell--non-numeric">Memory usage</td>
      <td class="mdl-data-table__cell--non-numeric">Display the current, hightest and free memory. Highest is the maximum memory recorded since database restarted.</td>

      <td class="mdl-data-table__cell--non-numeric">Display the current, hightest and free swap. Highest is the maximum swap recorded since database restarted.</td>
