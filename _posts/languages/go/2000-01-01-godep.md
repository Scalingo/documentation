This tutorial explains how to deploy a Go application which is using `godep`
to manage its dependencies. To handle the version management of the
dependencies, please follow [the offical godep
guide](https://github.com/tools/godep), this page will focus on the
deployment of the app.

## Configuration

During the deployment of a godep-ed application, we're looking at different special
keys in the configuration file `Godeps/Godeps.json` to give our deployment system the
data we need to deploy correctly the application:

* `GoVersion` (String): the version of Go you would like Scalingo to use when
  compiling your code. If not specified, we'll install the last stable version.

* `Packages` (Array of strings): What should be installed of your application.
  We'll default to `["."]` to install the package at the top level of your
  project, if your executable is in the `cmd` directory, another common choice is
  `["./cmd/..."]`. If you want to install all the packages including those which
  are vendored, you can use `["./..."]`.

* `ImportPath` (String): Name of the package installed during the deployment.
  If no `Packages` are present, the binary will have the name of the last part of
  the complete package name: `github.com/Scalingo/sample-go-martini` will create
  a binary named `sample-go-martini`.

Here is an example with `godep`: [https://github.com/Scalingo/sample-go-martini](https://github.com/Scalingo/sample-go-martini).

```json
{
  ...
  "ImportPath": "github.com/Scalingo/sample-go-martini"
  "GoVersion": "go1.9",
  "Packages": ["."],
  ...
}
```
