## Deploying a Go application

### Using Godeps

When deploying a go application it is important to ensure that the
compilation is completely reproducible.  Godeps ensures this by vendoring
all the third-party dependencies of your project in the `Godeps/_workspace`
directory of your project.

#### Setting up Godeps

```bash
go get github.com/tools/godep
godep save <package of your project>
git add Godeps
git commit -m "Vendor all dependencies with Godeps"
```

For more details about the management of these vendored dependencies,
refer to [the Godeps documentation](https://github.com/tools/godep).

#### Defining a Procfile

```yaml
web: <base package name>
```

Example if your package is `github.com/user/example`:

```yaml
web: example
```

You can find an example at: https://github.com/Scalingo/sample-go-martini

### Using .godir (Deprecated)

The alternative is to use a `.godir` file a the root of your project
defining the name of your project binary. All the dependencies will be
downloaded using `go get` and in this case the repeatability of the
operation is not ensured.

`.godir`:

```text
my-sample
```

`Procfile`:

```yaml
web: my-sample
```

## Common questions

### My application is only using the standard library, do I need Godeps

Yes, Godeps is not only about freezing dependencies version, it is also to save the go runtime you're using. We'll install the same version as the one specified in `Godeps/Godeps.json`, at the key `.GoVersion`

Example:

```json
{
	"ImportPath": "github.com/Scalingo/sample-go-maritni",
	"GoVersion": "go1.6",
	"Packages": [
		"github.com/Scalingo/sample-go-martini"
	],
  ...
}
```
