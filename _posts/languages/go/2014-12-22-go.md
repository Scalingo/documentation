The Go programming language is supported.

## Deploying a Go application

### Version compatibility

#### Officially supported

* `go1.9.2` (default)
* `go1.8.5`

#### Other versions

Any version of go can be used from go1.0.0, but it is advised to update your application to one of the officially supported versions.

### Managing dependencies

When deploying a go application it is important to ensure that the
compilation is completely reproducible, multiple tools are existing in
the go ecosystem, and Scalingo is compatible with the most used among them:

* With [`golang/dep`](https://github.com/golang/dep): [Documentation]({% post_url languages/go/2000-01-01-go-dependencies-with-dep %})
* With [`govendor`](https://github.com/kardianos/govendor): [Documentation]({% post_url languages/go/2000-01-01-govendor %})
* With [`godep`](https://github.com/tools/godep): [Documentation]({% post_url languages/go/2000-01-01-godep %})

#### Defining a Procfile

```yaml
web: <base package name>
```

Example if your package is `github.com/user/example`:

```yaml
web: example
```

### Using .godir (Deprecated)

The alternative is to use a `.godir` file a the root of your project
defining the name of your project binary. All the dependencies will be
downloaded using `go get` and in this case the repeatability of the
operation is not ensured.

`.godir`:

```text
my-sample
```

`Procfile`:

```yaml
web: my-sample
```

## Common questions

### My application is only using the standard library, do I need Godeps

Yes, Godeps is not only about freezing dependencies version, it is also to save the go runtime you're using. We'll install the same version as the one specified in `Godeps/Godeps.json`, at the key `.GoVersion`

Example:

```json
{
	"ImportPath": "github.com/Scalingo/sample-go-maritni",
	"GoVersion": "go1.6",
	"Packages": [
		"github.com/Scalingo/sample-go-martini"
	],
  ...
}
```
