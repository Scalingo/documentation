The Go programming language is supported.

## Deploying a Go application

### Version compatibility

#### Officially supported

* `go1.10.3` (default)
* `go1.9.7`

#### Other versions

Any version of Go can be used from go1.0.0, but it is advised to update your
application to one of the officially supported versions.

### Managing dependencies

When deploying a Go application it is important to ensure that the compilation
is completely reproducible, multiple tools exist in the Go ecosystem, and
Scalingo is compatible with the most used among them:

* With [`Go Modules`](https://github.com/golang/go/wiki/Modules): [Documentation]({% post_url languages/go/2000-01-01-gomod %})
* With [`golang/dep`](https://github.com/golang/dep): [Documentation]({% post_url languages/go/2000-01-01-dep %})
* With [`govendor`](https://github.com/kardianos/govendor): [Documentation]({% post_url languages/go/2000-01-01-govendor %})
* With [`godep`](https://github.com/tools/godep): [Documentation]({% post_url languages/go/2000-01-01-godep %})

#### Defining a Procfile

```yaml
web: <base package name>
```

Example if your package is `github.com/user/example`:

```yaml
web: example
```

You can find an example at: [https://github.com/Scalingo/sample-go-martini](https://github.com/Scalingo/sample-go-martini)

### Using .godir (Deprecated)

The alternative is to use a `.godir` file at the root of your project
defining the name of your project binary. All the dependencies will be
downloaded using `go get` and in this case the repeatability of the
operation is not ensured.

`.godir`:

```text
my-sample
```

`Procfile`:

```yaml
web: my-sample
```

## Common questions

### My application is only using the standard library, do I need Godeps or dep

Yes, Godeps and dep are not only about freezing dependencies version, it is
also to save the Go runtime you're using. We'll install the same version as the
one specified in `Godeps/Godeps.json`, at the key `.GoVersion`

Example:

```json
{
	"ImportPath": "github.com/Scalingo/sample-go-maritni",
	"GoVersion": "go1.10",
	"Packages": [
		"github.com/Scalingo/sample-go-martini"
	],
  ...
}
```
