## Initialize your application

```bash
$ rails new my-app

#
# It creates files and run 'bundle install'
#

$ git init
$ git add .
$ git commit -m "Base rails application"
```

## Create your application on Scalingo

<blockquote class="bg-info">
You can also use our web dashboard to achieve this operation
</blockquote>

```bash
$ scalingo create my-app
Git repository detected: remote scalingo added
→ 'git push scalingo master' to deploy your app
```

## Provision and configure your database

* Go on the [dashboard](https://my.scalingo.com/apps) of your application.
* Select the __Addons__ category
* Choose the database you want to use

### PostgreSQL

Add the gem `pg` to your `Gemfile`

### MySQL

Add the gem `mysql` to your `Gemfile`:

```ruby
gem 'mysql2', '~> v0.3.18'
```

Then set the following environment variable:

* `DATABASE_URL`
  → Copy the value of `SCALINGO_MYSQL_URL` and replace 'mysql://' by 'mysql2://'

{% include info_environment_how_to.md %}

### MongoDB

To use a MongoDB database your need to add the gem `mongoid` to your `Gemfile`.
Please refer to [this guide]({% post_url
languages/ruby/2014-10-17-configure-mongoid %}).

## Setup your application logging

By default, Rails applications don't write their logs to STDOUT but in a custom
file. We expect your application to write all its logging entries to STDOUT
and STDERR according to their nature, in accordance to the
[12-factor](http://12factor.net).

* Add the following gem in your `Gemfile`: `gem "rails_12factor"`

## Finalize and deploy

```bash
$ bundle install
$ git add .
$ git commit -m "Configure application for Scalingo"
$ git push scalingo master
```

## Access your application

```bash
…
Waiting for your application to boot...
<-- https://my-app.scalingo.io -->
```

A new application will render a 404 error `The page you were looking for doesn't exist.`,
but it's expected. There is nothing in the project, it's time to build your product!
