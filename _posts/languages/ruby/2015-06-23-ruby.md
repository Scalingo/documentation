Ruby is entirely supported by Scalingo, furthermore, custom support is added
for the Rails framework in all its versions.

## Buildpack

The buildpack is based on `bundler` and will install the dependencies defined
in the `Gemfile` and `Gemfile.lock` of your project. ([source of the
buildpack](https://github.com/Scalingo/heroku-buildpack-ruby))

it in your Gemfile:

### Ruby MRI 2.2.0

```ruby
ruby "2.2.0"
```

```ruby
ruby "2.0.0", :engine => "jruby", :engine_version => "1.7.20"
```
