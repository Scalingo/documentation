Ruby is officially supported by Scalingo. Furthermore, custom support is added
for the Rails framework in all its versions.

* [Getting Started with Rails]({% post_url languages/ruby/2015-02-17-getting-started-with-rails %})

## Buildpack

The buildpack is based on Bundler and will install the dependencies defined in
the `Gemfile` and `Gemfile.lock` of your project ([source of the
buildpack](https://github.com/Scalingo/ruby-buildpack)).

## Ruby application

Presence of a `Gemfile`

## Rack based application

Presence of a `config.ru`

### Rack environment

When a Rack application is detected, the following environment variable will
automatically be set by the platform:

* `RACK_ENV=production`

## Rails application

### Rails app detection

#### Rails 2

Presence of a `config/environment.rb`

#### Rails 3, Rails 4

For Rails 5.1, `node` and `yarn` will be automatically installed if the gem
`webpacker` is installed.

automatically be set by the platform:

* `RACK_ENV=production`

## Specifying a custom Ruby runtime

specifying it in your Gemfile:

### Ruby MRI 2.4.2

```ruby
ruby "2.4.2"
```

### JRuby 2.0.0

```ruby
ruby "2.0.0", :engine => "jruby", :engine_version => "1.7.20"
```
