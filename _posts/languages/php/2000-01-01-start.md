## Detection

Your application will be detected as a PHP application if:

* There is a `composer.lock` file at the root of your project
* `index.php` is present in the root directory (legacy app)

## Stack

A stack based on Nginx and PHP-FPM will be installed.

## Default Configuration

The default configuration for your application is defined in the buildpack's
[php.ini](https://github.com/Scalingo/php-buildpack/blob/master/conf/php/php.ini) and
[php-fpm.ini](https://github.com/Scalingo/php-buildpack/blob/master/conf/php/php-fpm.conf). You can
see on these files the configuration for parameters such as `upload_max_filesize` and `post_max_size`.

## PHP Versions

### Compatibility

The following PHP versions are compatible with the platform:

* **7.0** (up to 7.0.33)
* **7.1** (up to 7.1.33)
* **7.2** (up to 7.2.34)
* **7.3** (up to 7.3.30)
* **7.4** (up to 7.4.23)
* **8.0** (up to 8.0.10)

### Select a Version

By default, the latest **7.4** version of PHP will be installed, if you need to install
a precise version it should be mentioned in your `composer.json` file.

Example to install the latest PHP version from the `8.0` branch:

```json
{
  "require": {
    "php": "8.0"
  }
}
```

It installs the version 8.0.2 at the time of writing.

{% note %}
You should not specify a precise version such as `7.4.3` or you would miss
important updates. You should specify `7.4` to install a version `7.4.x` or
specify `7` to install a version `7.x`.
{% endnote %}

## Composer

Composer is the official package manager for PHP. The official website is
[here](https://getcomposer.org). It aims at handling the dependency management
of your application: installing dependencies and freezing their versions.

If composer is used in a project, the deployment system will detect it and use
it to install the dependencies of the project.

### composer.json

This file defines the different dependencies used by your application. It is also
used to configure custom deployment settings for the project (see below).

### composer.lock

Once the third-party libraries have been defined, their versions need to be
frozen in order to ensure a precise version of the application will always
deploy a compatible set of Composer packages. These versions will be written in
a `compose.lock` file. This file is _required_ as it is read during the
deployment on the platform.

To generate `compose.lock` you need to run:

```bash
$ composer install
```

When you need to upgrade a library, for instance `slim`:

```bash
$ composer update slim/slim
```

After each command, the `composer.lock` file will be updated automatically, do
not forget to commit the modifications of the file.

## Composer During the Deployment

It is considered that when an application is deployed on Scalingo, it is run in
"production" mode. As a result, `composer install` is run with the flag
`--no-dev`.

If, in order to debug an application, development dependencies should be
installed, please set the following environment variable:

* `COMPOSER_DEV=true`

### Select a Composer Version

You can select the Composer version to install for your application deployment by specifying it in your `composer.json`:

```json
{
  "extra": {
    "paas": {
      "engines": {
        "composer": "1.x"
      }
    }
  }
}
```

Scalingo supports the following versions of Composer:

- 1.10.21
- 2.1.6

## Native PHP Extensions

Applications might require native PHP extensions, these extensions are usually
written in C and need to be compiled as shared libraries (`.so` files) and be
used by PHP.

Some of them are bundled by default with the deployed version of PHP, the
others are installed dynamically if specified in the project `composer.json`.

### Native Extension Dependency

If an application requires a native PHP extension, it should be added in the
`require` block of its `composer.json`:

```json
{
  "require": {
    "ext-mongodb": "*",
    "ext-imagick": "*",
    ...
  }
}
```

These dependency instructions are parsed by the deployment system which will
install the require files.

## Officially Supported Frameworks

Scalingo supports out-of-the-box many well-known frameworks. When using such
frameworks, you have nothing special to configure in your `composer.json`,
`git push` your code and everything will work!

List of the frameworks:

* [Symfony from 2 to 5]({% post_url languages/php/2000-01-01-symfony %})
* [Laravel]({% post_url languages/php/2000-01-01-laravel %})
* Lumen
* Zend Framework 2
* Magento
* [Slim](https://sample-php-slim.scalingo.io/)
* Silex
* CakePHP 2 (up to PHP 7.3)
* Change 2
* [CodeIgniter 3]({% post_url languages/php/2000-01-01-codeigniter %})

## Configuration Tweaks

### Setup Basic Authentication

You may want to hide your application behind an authentication gateway.
You can [configure HTTP basic auth]({% post_url
languages/php/2000-01-01-basic-auth %}) for your application.

### PHP-FPM Concurrency

The level of concurrency configured is defined automatically according to the
size of the containers of your application. If you want to override this value,
you can define the environment variable: `WEB_CONCURRENCY`. It directly modifies
the
[`pm.max_children`](https://www.php.net/manual/fr/install.fpm.configuration.php)
parameter of PHP-FPM, defining how much process will be run by `php-fpm`.

Fine tuning the value of the `WEB_CONCURRENCY` environment variable is a bit
tricky and must be handled with care. There is no magic formulae and one must
load test his application to find the best value matching his use case. If the
application is swapping, you might need to lower the value of `WEB_CONCURRENCY`
and increase the amount of containers. On the contrary, if your application
does not use all his memory, one can try to slightly increase the
`WEB_CONCURRENCY` value and make sure the application does not start swapping.

Note that if the `WEB_CONCURRENCY` value is too high your application will not
be 100% available. You will see at some point the following error message in
your application logs, multiple times:

```text
connect() to unix:/tmp/php-fpm.sock failed (11: Resource temporarily
unavailable) while connecting to upstream, client: XXX.XXX.XXX.XXX, server:
localhost, request: "GET / HTTP/1.1", upstream:
"fastcgi://unix:/tmp/php-fpm.sock:", host: "example.com"
```

It happens when the PHP-FPM requests queue is full. Restarting your application
empties this requests queue and makes your application back up. Then you should
improve the value of the `WEB_CONCURRENCY` value.

### Buildpack Custom Configuration

{% note %}
  [_What is a buildpack?_]({% post_url platform/deployment/buildpacks/2000-01-01-intro %})
{% endnote %}

The buildpack allows you to configure precisely how your application is
deployed. This configuration is done in your `composer.json` at the _root_
of your project.

All these fields are __optional__, define them if you need to modify their
default value.

```json
{
  â€¦ // Your content
  "extra": {
    // default values of PaaS specific instructions
    "paas": {
      "document-root": "",
      "index-document": "index.php",
      "engines": {
        "nginx": "default"
      },
      "framework": "",
      "php-config": [],
      "php-includes": [],
      "php-fpm-config": [],
      "php-fpm-includes": [],
      "nginx-includes": [],
      "log-files": [],
      "compile": [],
      "new-relic": false,
      "access-log-format": ""
    }
  }
}
```

#### `.extra.paas.document-root`

The directory where Nginx will define the root of your app.

{% note %}
  It is empty by default, it means that Nginx will look at the `index.php` at the root of your project.
{% endnote %}

This parameter can also be overridden with the `DOCUMENT_ROOT` environment
variable.

#### `.extra.paas.framework`

Bypass framework detection by specifying the framework you want. It could also
be useful if you need to specify your application does not use any framework.
This is done by specifying `default` in the `.extra.paas.framework`
configuration.

#### `.extra.paas.index-document`

Name of the index document of each directory. When accessing a directory
(`https://example.osc-fr1.scalingo.io/web/`), Nginx looks by default for an
`index.php` file to execute, if your project is using another name, specify it
here.

#### `.extra.paas.engines.composer`

Define a specific version of Composer to use. By default your application uses the latest Composer version available. Most of the time, you don't need to change this value.

#### `.extra.paas.engines.nginx`

Define a precise version of Nginx to use. By default your application is
reachable through the last stable version of the server. Most of the time, you
don't need to change this value.

{% include nginx_versions.md %}

#### `.extra.paas.php-config`

List of directives which will be added to your `php.ini`. The default values used for your
application are in the buildpack's
[php.ini](https://github.com/Scalingo/php-buildpack/blob/master/conf/php/php.ini).

Example:

```json
{
  "php-config": [
    "display_errors=off",
    "short_open_tag=on"
  ]
}
```

#### `.extra.paas.php-fpm-config`

List of directives which will be added to your `php-fpm.ini`.

Example:

```json
{
  "php-fpm-config": [
    "log_level=debug"
  ]
}
```

#### `.extra.paas.php-includes`

Extra files which will be included in the `php.ini`.

#### `.extra.paas.php-fpm-includes`

Extra files which will be included in the `php-fpm.ini`.

#### `.extra.paas.nginx-http-includes`

Extra files which will be included in the Nginx configuration of your
application. These files are injected at the `http` scope of the
configuration file.

#### `.extra.paas.nginx-includes`

Extra files which will be included in the Nginx configuration of your
application. These files are injected at the `server` scope of the
configuration file.

#### `.extra.paas.compile`

Commands to run after the dependency installation.

Example:

```json
{
  "compile": [
    "php app/console assetic:dump --env=prod --no-debug"
  ]
}
```

#### `.extra.paas.log-files`

If your project is writing in custom log files, you can specify them here and
they will be streamed to the logs of your application.

Your can read the logs on your dashboard or with the Scalingo CLI utility.

#### `.extra.paas.new-relic`

If true, enable New Relic instrumentation tools.

The environment variable named `NEW_RELIC_LICENSE_KEY` is required.

It is also [highly
recommended](https://docs.newrelic.com/docs/agents/php-agent/configuration/php-agent-configuration#inivar-appname)
to include the `NEW_RELIC_APP_NAME` environment variable to specify the name of
the application as displayed in the New Relic UI.

#### `.extra.paas.access-log-format`

The format of the logs produced by the proxy Nginx for each request to your
application.

It is empty by default, it means that Nginx will use the following format:

```
'$http_x_forwarded_for - "$request" $status $body_bytes_sent "$http_referer" "$http_user_agent"'
```

e.g.

```
109.26.203.98 - "GET / HTTP/1.1" 200 1761 "http://google.com/search" "Mozilla/5.0 (Macintosh; Intel Mac OS X 10.12; rv:51.0) Gecko/20100101 Firefox/51.0"
```

{% note %}
  Note that the default output doesn't display any timestamp, as Scalingo log
  aggregation system will prepend it in the global logs of the application. For
  instance:

  `2017-01-26 12:02:06.504267001 +0100 CET [web-1] <nginx log output>`
{% endnote %}

When defining a custom value for the log format, please refer to the Nginx
[documentation
page](https://nginx.org/en/docs/http/ngx_http_log_module.html#log_format)..

This parameter can also be overridden with the `ACCESS_LOG_FORMAT` environment
variable.

## Warning: `.htaccess` Files

Legacy projects often use `.htaccess` file in their project to modify the
configuration of the Apache server. As the buildpack is based on Nginx and
PHP-FPM, these files are ineffective.

Instead of using these files, you have to write directives for Nginx and
configure the `nginx-includes` part of your `composer.json`. It can contains
one or more configuration files:

```json
{
  â€¦
  "extra": {
    "paas": {
      "nginx-includes": ["path/to/nginx_conf_file", â€¦]
    }
  }
}
```

## Example: Configuring Rate Limiting

The following process setup rate limiting, 1 requests per second per IP.

1. Create a file 'nginx-http.conf'

```
limit_req_zone $binary_remote_addr zone=mylimit:10m rate=1r/s;
```

2. Create a file 'nginx-app.conf'

```
location /login {
    limit_req zone=mylimit;
    try_files $uri $uri/ /index.php?$query_string;
}
```

3. Modify your composer.json

```
{
  [...]
  "extra": {
    "paas": {
      "nginx-http-includes": ["nginx-http.conf"]
      "nginx-includes": ["nginx-app.conf"]
    }
  }
}
```


## Example: URL Rewriting (e.g. WordPress)

Here is an example of legacy `.htaccess` which won't work on Scalingo. You need
to replace it with the Nginx configuration following the example.

Legacy `.htaccess` example:

```ApacheConf
<IfModule mod_rewrite.c>
RewriteEngine On
RewriteBase /
RewriteRule ^index\.php$ - [L]
RewriteCond %{REQUEST_FILENAME} !-f
RewriteCond %{REQUEST_FILENAME} !-d
RewriteRule . /index.php [L]
</IfModule>
```

Nginx configuration:

```nginx
location / {
  try_files $uri $uri/ /index.php?$args;
}
```
