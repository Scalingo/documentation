## Detection

Your application will be detected as a PHP application if:

* There is a `composer.lock` file at the root of your project
* `index.php` is present in the root directory (legacy app)

## Stack

The PHP buildpack provided by Scalingo is based on Nginx and PHP-FPM.

## Composer

Composer is the official package manager for PHP. The official
website is [https://getcomposer.org/](https://getcomposer.org/). You can
find their its configuration. This buildpack is based on Composer. The
dependencies of your app will be installed according to your Composer configuration

### composer.json

This file defines the different dependencies used by your application. It is also
used to configure custom settings of your project (see below)

### composer.lock

When you have defined the different third-party libraries you want to use, you need
to fix the version you want to install. These versions will be written in a `compose.lock`
file. This file will be read to deploy your application on Scalingo, so it is _required_

To generate `compose.lock` you need to run

```bash
$ composer install
```

When you need to upgrade a library, for instance slim:

```bash
$ composer update slim/slim
```

The composer.lock file will be updated automatically, do not forget to commit the
modifications of the file.

Composer during the deployment
------------------------------

We consider that when you deploy your application on Scalingo that your want it
to run in "production" mode. As a result, `composer install` is run with the flag
`--no-dev`.

If, in order to debug your application, you wish to install development dependencies,
you can set the following environment variable:

* `COMPOSER_DEV` → `true`

## Officially supported frameworks

For these framework we have done some extra work to save your configuration
worktime.  Actually you have nothing special to configure in your
`composer.json`, just `git push` your code and everything will work out of the
box.

List of the frameworks:

* [Symfony 2]({% post_url languages/php/2000-01-01-php-symfony2-deployment %})
* Zend Framework 2
* Magento
* Slim
* Laravel
* Lumen
* Silex
* Cake PHP 2
* Change 2

## Configuration tweaks

### Setup basic auth

You may want to hide your application behind a simple authentication gateway, you
can [configure HTTP basic auth]({% post_url languages/php/2000-01-01-php-basic-auth %}) for you application.

### Buildpack tweaks - custom configuration

> [_What is a buildpack_]({% post_url internals/buildpacks/2015-01-04-buildpacks %})

The buildpack allows you to configure precisely how your application are
deployed. This configuration is done in your `composer.json` at the _root_
of your project.

All these fields are __optional__, define them if you need to modify their default value.

```json
{
  … // Your content
  "extra": {
    // default values of PaaS specific instructions
    "paas": {
      "document-root": "",
      "index-document": "index.php",
      "engines": {
        "nginx": "default",
        "php": "default"
      },
      "php-config": [],
      "php-includes": [],
      "php-fpm-config": [],
      "php-fpm-includes": [],
      "nginx-includes": [],
      "log-files": [],
      "compile": [],
      "new-relic": false,
      "access-log-format": ""
    }
  }
}
```

### .extra.paas.document-root

The directory where nginx will define the root of your app.

> It is empty by default, it means that nginx will look at
> the index.php at the root of your project.

This parameter can also be overrided with the environment variable:

* `DOCUMENT_ROOT`

### .extra.paas.index-document

Name of the index document of each directory. When accessing a directory
(`https://example.scalingo.io/web/`), nginx looks by default to an index.php
file to execute, if your project is using another name, specify it here.

### .extra.paas.engines.nginx

Define a precise version of nginx to use. By default we prive to your app
the last stable version of the server, so in most of the time, you don't need
to change its value.

### .extra.paas.engines.php

Define a precise version of PHP to use. The last stable version will be installed
if nothing is specified.

Example

```json
{
  "engines": {
    "php": "~7.0"
  },
}
```

### .extra.paas.php-config

List of directive which will be added to your `php.ini`

Examples

```json
{
  "php-config": [
    "display_errors=off",
    "short_open_tag=on"
  ]
}
```

### .extra.paas.php-fpm-config

List of directive which will be added to your `php-fpm.ini`

Examples

```json
{
  "php-fpm-config": [
    "log_level=debug"
  ]
}
```

### .extra.paas.php-includes

Extra files which will be included in the `php.ini`

### .extra.paas.php-fpm-includes

Extra files which will be included in the `php-fpm.ini`

### .extra.paas.nginx-includes

Extra files which will be included in the Nginx configuration
of your application

### .extra.paas.compile

Commands to run after the dependency installation.

```json
{
  "compile": [
    "php app/console assetic:dump --env=prod --no-debug"
  ]
}
```

### .extra.paas.log-files

If your project is writing in custom logfiles, you can specify them
here and they will be streamed to the logs of your application.

Your can read the logs on your dashboard or with the Scalingo CLI utility.

### .extra.paas.new-relic

If true, enable new-relic instrumentation tools.

The environment variable named `NEW_RELIC_LICENSE_KEY` is required.

### .extra.paas.access-log-format

The format of the logs produced by the proxy nginx for each request to your
application.

It is empty by default, it means that nginx will use the following format:

```
'$http_x_forwarded_for - "$request" $status $body_bytes_sent "$http_referer" "$http_user_agent"'
```

ie.

```
109.26.203.98 - "GET / HTTP/1.1" 200 1761 "http://google.com/search" "Mozilla/5.0 (Macintosh; Intel Mac OS X 10.12; rv:51.0) Gecko/20100101 Firefox/51.0"
```

> Note that the default output doesn't display any timestamp, as Scalingo log
> aggregation system will prepend it in the global logs of the application: For
> instance `2017-01-26 12:02:06.504267001 +0100 CET [web-1] <nginx log output>`

So when defining a custom value for the log format, please refer to the nginx
[documentation page](https://nginx.org/en/docs/http/ngx_http_log_module.html#log_format)

This parameter can also be overrided with the environment variable:

* `ACCESS_LOG_FORMAT`

## Warning: .htaccess files

Legacy projects often use `.htaccess` file in their project to modify
the configuration of the frontal Apache server. As the buildpack is
based on Nginx + PHP-FPM, these files are ineffective.

Instead of using these files, you have write directives for nginx and
configure the `nginx-includes` part of your composer.json. It can contains
one or more configuration files:

```json
{
  …
  "extra": {
    "paas": {
      "nginx-includes" = ["path/to/nginx_conf_file", …]
    }
  }
}
```


### Example: URL rewriting (i.e. Wordpress)

Here is an example of legacy .htaccess. This file won't work on Scalingo,
you need to replace it with the nginx configuration following the example.

.htaccess

```conf
<IfModule mod_rewrite.c>
RewriteEngine On
RewriteBase /
RewriteRule ^index\.php$ - [L]
RewriteCond %{REQUEST_FILENAME} !-f
RewriteCond %{REQUEST_FILENAME} !-d
RewriteRule . /index.php [L]
</IfModule>
```

nginx configuration

```nginx
location / {
  try_files $uri $uri/ /index.php?$args;
}
```
