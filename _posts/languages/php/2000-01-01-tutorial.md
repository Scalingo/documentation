This tutorial will help you deploy a PHP application in a few minutes. We will also guide you
through the different features Scalingo offers.

{% include info_tutorial_requirements.md %}

## Deploy an Application

This sample application uses [Composer](https://getcomposer.org), a famous dependency management
tool for PHP. Please install it before proceeding to the tutorial.

### Prepare the Application Code

First create a `composer.json` file at the root of your project containing some information about
your application:

```json
{
	"description": "My wonderful application",
	"name": "my-company/my-app",
	"homepage": "https://www.my-app.com",
	"license": "MIT",
	"config": {
		"platform": {
			"php": "7.2"
		}
	}
}
```

Then add a PHP application by creating a `index.php` file at the root of your application:

```php
<h1>Hello World from a Scalingo application</h1>
```

Last you need to lock your application dependencies (even though there are none at the moment) with:

```bash
$ composer install
Loading composer repositories with package information
Updating dependencies (including require-dev)
Nothing to install or update
Writing lock file
Generating autoload files
```

Note that this step generated a `compose.lock` file and a `vendor` folder at the root of your
application.

The rest of the tutorial assumes that you are located in the `my-app` folder.

### Deploy the Application

In this step we deploy the application on Scalingo to get it up and running. Scalingo uses the Git
version-control system to make it easier to send your application source code. Let's first
initialize a Git repository:

```bash
$ git init
Initialized empty Git repository in /home/username/my-app/.git/
```

We can now add and commit our application files we previously created:

```bash
$ git add index.php composer.json composer.lock vendor
$ git commit --message "Initial commit"
```

Then create the app on Scalingo with:

```bash
$ scalingo create my-app
App 'my-app' has been created
Git repository detected: remote scalingo added
â†’ 'git push scalingo master' to deploy your app
```

When you create an app, a Git remote (called `scalingo`) is also created and associated with your
local Git repository.

Deploy the application with:

```bash
$ git push scalingo master

## Logs

Your application generates logs readable with:

```text

```

Access the application once using a web browser and you will get a new line of
logs:

```
2018-02-23 16:47:52.536015907 +0100 CET [web-1] 90.63.216.93 - "GET / HTTP/1.1" 200 24989 "-" "Mozilla/5.0 (X11; Linux x86_64; rv:58.0) Gecko/20100101 Firefox/58.0"
```

## Scale

By default, the application runs on a single container. You can check the number of containers
running your application with:

```bash
$ scalingo ps
+------+--------+------+---------+
| NAME | AMOUNT | SIZE | COMMAND |
+------+--------+------+---------+
| web  | 1      | M    | -       |
+------+--------+------+---------+
```

If redundancy is important or if a high traffic is expected, scale the application to use more
containers. For instance, scale the application to use three containers with:

```bash
$ scalingo scale web:3
Your application is being scaled to:
  web: 3 - M
Status: Done in 8.177 seconds
Your application has been scaled.
```

You can also check the application usage to better understand whether it is important to scale or
not with:

```
$ scalingo stats
+-------+-----+-----------------+----------------+
| NAME  | CPU |     MEMORY      |      SWAP      |
+-------+-----+-----------------+----------------+
| web-1 | 0%  | 4%  24MB/512MB  | 0%   0B/512MB  |
|       |     | Highest:  25MB  | Highest:   0B  |
|       |     |                 |                |
| web-2 | 0%  | 4%  24MB/512MB  | 0%   0B/512MB  |
|       |     | Highest:  25MB  | Highest:   0B  |
|       |     |                 |                |
| web-3 | 0%  | 4%  24MB/512MB  | 0%   0B/512MB  |
|       |     | Highest:  24MB  | Highest:   0B  |
+-------+-----+-----------------+----------------+
```

## Deploy Modifications of an App

In this step, we will see how to modify an application, and reflect your local modification on the
Scalingo application. We will add a dependency to [Cowsay](https://github.com/alrik11es/cowsayphp),
and modify the application to use it.

First add the dependency with:

```bash
$ composer require alrik11es/cowsayphp
Using version ^1.2 for alrik11es/cowsayphp
./composer.json has been updated
Loading composer repositories with package information
Updating dependencies (including require-dev)
Package operations: 1 install, 0 updates, 0 removals
  - Installing alrik11es/cowsayphp (1.2.0): Downloading (100%)
Writing lock file
Generating autoload files
```

And replace the content of `index.php` to use this library:

```php
<?php
require_once __DIR__.'/vendor/autoload.php';

use Cowsayphp\Farm;
$whale = Farm::create(\Cowsayphp\Farm\Whale::class);
echo '<pre>'.$whale->say("Hi there!").'</pre>';
```

Commit your changes with:

```bash
$ git add index.php composer.json composer.lock vendor
$ git commit --message "Add Cowsay"
```

Now deploy to Scalingo, as you did previously:

```bash
$ git push scalingo master
```

With this introduction on how Scalingo works, you can now develop your project and build something
amazing!

on how to customize the container your application will execute on.
