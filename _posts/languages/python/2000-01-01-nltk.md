NLTK (Natural Language Toolkit) is a well-known platform for Python application dealing with human
language data. It includes many downloadable lexical resources (named corpora). If your
application requires some corpora to work, add a `nltk.txt` file at the root of the
application containing a corpora name per line. For instance:

```text
punkt
stopwords
```

The Python buildpack will automatically download them during the deployment of your
application.

Note that there is a [known issue](https://github.com/nltk/nltk/issues/2162) on nltk which leads to
an unharmful warning message when your app starts:

```text
RuntimeWarning: 'nltk.downloader' found in sys.modules after import of package 'nltk', but prior to execution of 'nltk.downloader'; this may result in unpredictable behaviour
```

You can safely ignore it.
