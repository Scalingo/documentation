The Python language is officially supported on the platform.

## Detection

To ensure our deployment system considers your application as a Python
application, a file `requirements.txt` or `setup.py` should be present at the
root of your project, defining the dependencies of your app.

## Versions

Python 2 and Python 3 are both completely supported, you can specify the
runtime version in the `runtime.txt` file at the root of your repository.

Example of `runtime.txt` which would install Python 3.6.4:

```text
python-3.6.4
```

## Frameworks

We handle most of the common frameworks. Obviously, Django is among them. You just need ton
configure your application to bind the port defined by the environment variable `$PORT`.
