The python Language is supported

## Detection

To ensure our deployment system considers your application as a Python application,
a file `requirements.txt` or `setup.py` should be present at the root of your project, defining
the dependencies of your app.

## Versions

Python 2 and Python 3 are both completely supported, you can specify the runtime version in th
`runtime.txt` file at the root of your repository.

Example of `runtime.txt` which would install python 3.6.0:

```text
python-3.6.0
```

## Frameworks

We handle most of the common frameworks. Obviously, Django is among them. You just need ton
configure your application to bind the port defined by the environment variable `$PORT`
