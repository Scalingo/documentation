Erlang is officially supported on the platform.

It uses [Rebar](https://github.com/rebar/rebar).

### Configure your Scalingo App

```bash
$ scalingo create my-app
```

Nothing else.

### Select an Erlang version

The Erlang/OTP release version that will be used to build and run your application is now sourced
from a dotfile called `.preferred_otp_version`. It needs to be the branch or tag name from the
[https://github.com/erlang/otp](https://github.com/erlang/otp) repository, and further, needs to be
one of the versions that precompiled binaries are available for.

Currently supported OTP versions:

* master (R17B pre)
* master-pu (R16B pre)
* `OTP_R15B`
* `OTP_R15B01`
* `OTP_R15B02`
* `OTP_R16B`
* `OTP_R16B01`
* `OTP_R16B02`
* `OTP_R16B03`

To select the version for your app:

```bash
$ echo OTP_R15B01 > .preferred_otp_version
$ git commit -m "Select R15B01 as preferred OTP version" .preferred_otp_version
```

### Build your Scalingo App

```bash
$ git push scalingo master
```

You may need to write a new commit and push if your code was already up to date.
