If the result of your maven build results in a `.war` file, a little additional
work is required.

## Add the webapp-runner as dependency

To correctly execute your war file, we need you to add the
[webapp-runner](https://github.com/jsimone/webapp-runner) dependency to your
`pom.xml` file. This dependency let us start your application by starting
Tomcat in a simple command.

```xml
<build>
  ...
  <plugins>
    ...
    <plugin>
      <groupId>org.apache.maven.plugins</groupId>
      <artifactId>maven-dependency-plugin</artifactId>
      <version>2.3</version>
      <executions>
        <execution>
          <phase>package</phase>
          <goals><goal>copy</goal></goals>
          <configuration>
            <artifactItems>
              <artifactItem>
                <groupId>com.github.jsimone</groupId>
                <artifactId>webapp-runner</artifactId>
                <version>7.0.57.2</version>
                <destFileName>webapp-runner.jar</destFileName>
              </artifactItem>
            </artifactItems>
          </configuration>
        </execution>
      </executions>
    </plugin>
  </plugins>
</build>
```

## Define your Procfile

To tell use how to start your application, you need to create a `Procfile` file
at the root of your project: [more doc about Procfiles]({% post_url internals/2014-12-01-procfile %})

```yaml
web: java $JAVA_OPTS -jar target/dependency/webapp-runner.jar --port $PORT target/*.war
```

That's it, just commit your `pom.xml` and your `Procfile` and your app will deploy in the
blink of an eye.

## Cleanup your application image

When you prepare a `war` archive from your application. Every dependency is packaged
into it and the war file should be almost autonomous. You don't need too keep all your
build dependencies in your application image.

To do so, [create a `.slugingore` file]({% post_url internals/2015-03-24-slugignore %})
and list the directories which are not essential to your application.

### Example

Once built, a Java application will contain the following file tree structure:

```text
my-app/src
my-app/target
my-app/target/classes
my-app/pom.xml
target/my-app.war
.m2/
.jdk/
pom.xml
Procfile
.slugingore
.gitignore
```

For instance, the `.slugignore` file may contain:

```text
.m2
```

As a result, all the maven local repository will be excluded from the
application image.
