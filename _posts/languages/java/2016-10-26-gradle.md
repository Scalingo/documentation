Scalingo supports Gradle, a famous build automation system for Java. The details of the Scalingo's Java support are described in [this article](http://doc.scalingo.com/languages/java/).

This buildpack will detect your app as using Gradle if it has a `build.gradle` file, `settings.gradle` file, or `gradlew` file. If you are using `gradlew, do not forget to add the `gradle/wrapper` directory to your git repository:

```
git commit gradlew gradle/wrapper -m "Gradle Wrapper"
```
Then deploy again with `git push scalingo master`. 

Note: These files must not be in your `.gitignore`. If you forgot to add these files, you will receive the following error:

```
-----> executing ./gradlew stage
       Error: Could not find or load main class org.gradle.wrapper.GradleWrapperMain
```

## Verify that your build file is set up correctly

The Gradle buildpack will run different build tasks depending on the framework it detects. If your framework is [Spring Boot](http://doc.scalingo.com/languages/java/spring-boot.html), it will run `./gradlew build -x test`. For Ratpack, it will run `./gradlew installDist -x test`. If no known web frameworks are detected, it will run `./gradlew stage`.

To create a custom task, you can create a `stage` task in your `build.gradle` file like:

```
task stage(dependsOn: ['build', 'clean'])
build.mustRunAfter clean
```

You can also override the default task by setting the `GRADLE_TASK` environment variable either on the dashboard or using the CLI tool:

```
scalingo env-set GRADLE_TASK="build"
```

## Default web process type

Depending on the detected framework, this buildpack will automatically create a web procees. For Spring Boot, the web process will be:

```
java -Dserver.port=$PORT $JAVA_OPTS -jar build/libs/*.jar
```
For Ratpack, the web process will be:
```
build/install/${rootProject.name}/bin/${rootProject.name}
```
with `${rootProject.name} the configured value in your Gradle build (probably in your `settings.gradle`).

If you need to customize the default web process, you must create a [`Procfile`](http://doc.scalingo.com/internals/procfile.html).

## Using Grails 3

Grails 3 requires both to have webapp-runner and to setup a custom `stage` task in your `build.gradle`. First, add the following line in the `dependencies` section:

```
compile "com.github.jsimone:webapp-runner:8.5.5.0"
```

Then add this at the end of your `build.gradle`:
```
task stage() {
    dependsOn clean, war
}
tasks.stage.doLast() {
    delete fileTree(dir: "build/distributions")
    delete fileTree(dir: "build/assetCompile")
    delete fileTree(dir: "build/distributions")
    delete fileTree(dir: "build/libs", exclude: "*.war")
}
war.mustRunAfter clean

task copyToLib(type: Copy) {
    into "$buildDir/server"
    from(configurations.compile) {
        include "webapp-runner*"
    }
}

stage.dependsOn(copyToLib)
```

Eventually, create a `Procfile` at the root of your project with this web process:
```
web: cd build ; java -Dgrails.env=prod -jar ../build/server/webapp-runner-*.jar --expand-war --port $PORT ./libs/*.war
```
Moving into the `build` directory is mandatory for Grails.
