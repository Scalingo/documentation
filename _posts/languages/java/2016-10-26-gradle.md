Scalingo supports Gradle, a famous build automation system for Java. The
details of the Scalingo's Java support are described in [this
article](http://doc.scalingo.com/languages/java/).

This buildpack will detect your app as using Gradle if it has a `build.gradle`
file, `settings.gradle` file, or `gradlew` file at the root of your project. If
you are using `gradlew`, **do not forget to add the `gradle/wrapper`**
directory to your Git repository:

```
git commit gradlew gradle/wrapper -m "Gradle Wrapper"
```

Then deploy again with `git push scalingo master`.

Note: These files must not be in your `.gitignore`. If you forgot to add these
files, you will receive the following error:

```
-----> executing ./gradlew stage
       Error: Could not find or load main class org.gradle.wrapper.GradleWrapperMain
```

## Verify that your build file is set up correctly

The Gradle buildpack will run different build tasks depending on the framework
it detects. If your framework is [Spring
Boot](http://doc.scalingo.com/languages/java/spring-boot.html), it will run
`./gradlew build -x test`. For Ratpack, it will run `./gradlew installDist -x
test`. If no known web frameworks are detected, it will run `./gradlew stage`.

To create a custom task, you can create a `stage` task in your `build.gradle`
file like this:

```
task stage(dependsOn: ['build', 'clean'])
build.mustRunAfter clean
```

You can also override the default task by setting the `GRADLE_TASK` environment
variable either on the dashboard or using the CLI tool:

```
scalingo env-set GRADLE_TASK="build"
```

## Default web process type

Depending on the detected framework, this buildpack will automatically create a
web process. For Spring Boot, the web process will be:

```
java -Dserver.port=$PORT $JAVA_OPTS -jar build/libs/*.jar
```

For Ratpack, the web process will be:

```
build/install/${rootProject.name}/bin/${rootProject.name}
```

with `${rootProject.name}` the configured value in your Gradle build (probably
in your `settings.gradle`).

If you need to customize the default web process, you must create a
[`Procfile`]({% post_url internals/2014-12-01-procfile %}).

## Using Grails 3

Grails 3 requires both to have webapp-runner and to setup a custom `stage` task
in your `build.gradle`. First, add the following line in the `dependencies`
section:

```
compile "com.github.jsimone:webapp-runner:8.5.5.0"
```

Then add this at the end of your `build.gradle`:

```
task stage() {
    dependsOn clean, war
}
tasks.stage.doLast() {
    delete fileTree(dir: "build/distributions")
    delete fileTree(dir: "build/assetCompile")
    delete fileTree(dir: "build/distributions")
    delete fileTree(dir: "build/libs", exclude: "*.war")
}
war.mustRunAfter clean

task copyToLib(type: Copy) {
    into "$buildDir/server"
    from(configurations.compile) {
        include "webapp-runner*"
    }
}

stage.dependsOn(copyToLib)
```

Eventually, create a `Procfile` at the root of your project with this web process:

```
web: cd build ; java -Dgrails.env=prod -jar ../build/server/webapp-runner-*.jar --expand-war --port $PORT ./libs/*.war
```

Moving into the `build` directory is mandatory for Grails.
