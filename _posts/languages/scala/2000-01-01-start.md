Scala is officially supported on Scalingo.

It uses [sbt](https://github.com/sbt/sbt) 0.11.0+.

## Usage

Example usage:

```bash
$ ls
Procfile build.sbt project src

$ scalingo create my-app

$ git push scalingo master
...
-----> Scala app detected
-----> Building app with sbt
-----> Running: sbt compile stage
```

The buildpack will detect your app as Scala if it has the
`project/build.properties` and either `*.sbt` in the root directory or
`project/*.scala` or `.sbt/*.scala`. It vendors a version of sbt and your
populated `.ivy/cache` into your container. The `.ivy2` directory will be
cached between builds to allow for faster build times.

## Clean builds

In some cases, builds need to clean artifacts before compiling. If a clean
build is necessary, configure builds to perform clean by setting
`SBT_CLEAN=true`:

```bash
$ scalingo env-set SBT_CLEAN=true
SBT_CLEAN has been set to true.
```

All subsequent deploys will use the clean task. To remove the clean task, unset `SBT_CLEAN`:

```bash
$ scalingo env-unset SBT_CLEAN
SBT_CLEAN has been unset.
```
