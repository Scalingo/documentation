Scala is officially supported on Scalingo.

It uses [sbt](https://github.com/sbt/sbt) 0.11.0+.

Usage
-----

Example usage:

```bash
$ ls
Procfile build.sbt project src

$ scalingo create scala-app

$ git push scalingo master
...
-----> Scala app detected
-----> Building app with sbt
-----> Running: sbt compile stage
```

The buildpack will detect your app as Scala if it has the `project/build.properties` and either `*.sbt` in the root dir or `project/*.scala` or `.sbt/*.scala` based build config.  It vendors a version of sbt and your popluated .ivy/cache into your container.  The .ivy2 directory will be cached between builds to allow for faster build times.

Clean builds
------------

In some cases, builds need to clean artifacts before compiling. If a clean build is necessary, configure builds to perform clean by setting `SBT_CLEAN=true`:

```bash
$ scalingo env-set SBT_CLEAN=true
SBT_CLEAN has been set to true.
```

All subsequent deploys will use the clean task. To remove the clean task, unset `SBT_CLEAN`:

```bash
$ scalingo env-unset SBT_CLEAN
SBT_CLEAN has been unset.
```
