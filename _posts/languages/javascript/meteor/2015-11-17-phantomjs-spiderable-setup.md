## Context

A Meteor application is a fully dynamic website. When a request is done
to the application it returns an almost empty page containing one JavaScript
file which takes care to start the app on the client browser.

When a crawler like **GoogleBot** is looking at your website it is specifying
the following query parameter `_escaped_fragment_=`

In this case Meteor has been built to use PhantomJS through the `spiderable`
package to generate the static rendering of your application.

## Meteor package 'ongoworks:spiderable'

```bash
meteor add ongoworks:spiderable
```

By adding this package, your website will automatically respond to the requests
of static fragment. You can try the following request on your application in
development:

```
curl http://localhost:3000?_escaped_fragment_=
```

## Incompatible package `spiderable`

The package named `spiderable` is not compatible with restricted environment
like Scalingo's containers, that is why we are advising you to use
`ongoworks:spiderable` instead of `spiderable`

## Installation of PhantomJS

### Meteor version â‰¥ 1.3

PhantomJS installation has to be done from the npm package of the same name.

```bash
meteor npm install --save phantomjs
```

### Meteor version < 1.3

npm modules can't be used easily, so we have to use a wrapper around the
original npm module, use the package `dfischer:phantomjs` from atmosphere:

```bash
meteor add dfischer:phantomjs
```

## Common problem

### `spiderable` package is used

```text

```

As stated in this article the package `ongoworks:spiderable` should be used as
in-place replacement of the `spiderable` package, please run the following
commands:

```bash
meteor remove spiderable
meteor add ongoworks:spiderable
git add .meteor/versions .meteor/packages
git commit -m "use ongoworks:spiderable instead of spiderable"
git push scalingo master
```
