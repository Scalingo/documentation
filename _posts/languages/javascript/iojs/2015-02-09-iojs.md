## Getting started tutorial

To deploy your first __io.js__ application, follow the [Getting started with
io.js]({% post_url
languages/javascript/iojs/2015-02-09-getting-started-with-iojs %}) guide.

## Description

io.js is a fork from the Node.js project and is compatible with
the whole `npm` ecosystem. So it is used as a runtime for your
JavaScript code, server side.

## How to convert a Node.js application to io.js

> Node.js support: http://doc.scalingo.com/languages/javascript/nodejs

It is pretty straightforward, you just have to change the engine
you want to use in your `package.json`.

Instead of having no `engines` section, or a block like:

```json
{
  "engines": {
    "node": "0.12.x"
  }
}
```

Write

```json
{
  "engines": {
    "iojs": "1.1.x"
  }
}
```
