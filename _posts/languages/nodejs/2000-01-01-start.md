Node.js is supported by Scalingo, furthermore, custom support has been added to
manage the [__Meteor__]({% post_url
languages/meteorjs/2000-01-01-start %}) framework.

## Standard Node Applications

### Node.js app detection

The file `package.json` should be present at the root of the project.

### Dependencies installation

The dependencies of your project are installed either with the [npm package
manager](https://www.npmjs.com/) or the [Yarn package
manager](https://yarnpkg.com/).

If a `yarn.lock` file is present at the root of your project, yarn will be used
to install the dependencies and run scripts, otherwise npm will build the
dependencies during the deployment.

{% note %}
  You can specify the version of yarn you want to use by defining it in the
  `package.json` file, with the key `engines.yarn`.
{% endnote %}

{% note %}
  Yarn does not handle private modules, if you use them, keep using npm
{% endnote %}

### Install devDependencies

By default, dependencies present in the `devDependencies` field are not
installed since they should not be needed for production. If you want to
install them, you'll need to set the `NPM_CONFIG_PRODUCTION` environment
variable to false via our web interface or by using our CLI:

```bash
$ scalingo --app my-app env-set NPM_CONFIG_PRODUCTION=false
```

### Ensure you're tracking all your dependencies

It is important to ensure you are tracking all the dependencies of your project
in the `package.json` file. Otherwise your app may build but will potentially
crash during its runtime, failing to find a dependency.

A common mistake is to run `npm install` without the `--save` flag. In this
case the dependency is installed in the `node_modules` directory, but nothing
is tracked in the `package.json` file.

You should also avoid to install global packages (i.e. using the `-g` flag). In
this case packages are installed at the system level and are not tracked for
your project.

In a nutshell: you should always use the following command when adding a
dependency:

```
npm install --save <module>
```

{% note %}
  If the module contains a binary like `grunt` or `gulp`, they will be
  installed in the `node_modules/.bin` directory, keeping them local and
  trackable. On Scalingo, the `node_modules/.bin` directory is added to your
  `PATH`, so you can directly use them.
{% endnote %}

### Do not track modules with Git

When working locally on your code, after running `npm install`, a directory
`node_modules` containing the dependencies of your application is created. You
should not check this directory in your Git repository. If the dependency is
listed in your `package.json` file, it will automatically be installed during
the deployment of your application.

Adding these files to Git will create confusion and unnecessary noise in your
code history and we consider it's a good practice to keep it clean, only add
the useful code (the code of your project). Moreover there is an issue with
dependencies which build binaries during their installation. If your add these
binaries to your repository, it may create incompatibility with Scalingo
runtime environment.

The good method to avoid checking in these files is to add the following
content in a `.gitignore` file at the root of your project and commit this
file:

```text
node_modules
bower_components
# Any other file created by grun/gulp/webpack builds
```

Once done, Git will ignore these directories when making commits.

### Specifying a Node.js version

In your `engines` section of your `package.json` file, you can specify a
version of Node.js to use. If no version is defined, we'll install the latest
stable version. It's exactly the same with `npm` if you want to use a specific
version of it.

```json
{
  "name": "my-app",
  "engines": {
    "node": "4.2.x",
    "npm": "2.14.x"
  }
}
```

### Node.js app startup

What we use in order of priority

1. `Procfile` at the root of your project
2. The field `.scripts.start` defined in your `package.json`

Example of `package.json`:

```json
{
  ...
  "scripts": {
    "start": "node server.js"
  }
}
```

### Node.js build hooks

You may want to run custom commands or scripts before or after the installation of dependencies. This is possible thanks to commands named `prebuild` and `build`. The first is run before installing dependencies and the latter after. To use them, add the commands you wish to run in the `package.json` the following way:

```json
{
  ...
  "scripts": {
    "prebuild": "node prebuild.js",
    "build": "grunt build"
  }
}
```

* The hook `prebuild` has the following alias: `scalingo-prebuild`
* The hook `build` has the following aliases: `postbuild`, `scalingo-postbuild`

### Custom cache folder

By default, Scalingo stores the directories `bower_components` and `node_modules` at the root of the
project in the deployment
cache. But you might need to add different folders to this cache. You can override these defaults by
specifying the `cacheDirectories` (or `cache_directories`) key at the root of your `package.json`
file.

For example, if your application has a client and a server in the same repository, you can specify
these folders to store them in the deployment cache with:

```json
"cacheDirectories": ["client/node_modules", "server/node_modules"]
```

## Meteor Application

If a `.meteor` file is detected at the root of your project, your app will
be considered as a Meteor application.

See the [Meteor applications documentation]({% post_url
languages/meteorjs/2000-01-01-start %})

## React Native Application

A React Native application is a client-side Javascript application (mostly Javascript files).
Deploying one on Scalingo requires a minimal web server such as the one presented [here]({%
post_url platform/app/2000-01-01-static-files-hosting %}).
