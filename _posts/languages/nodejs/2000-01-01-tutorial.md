## Initialize Your Application

```bash
$ mkdir my-app
$ cd my-app
$ npm init

#
# You need to fill the different info field for your project
#

$ npm install express --save
$ echo "node_modules" > .gitignore
```

## Write a Base Server File

The main file for this sample project is `server.js`:

```js
// Node.js - Express sample application

var express = require('express')
var app = express()

app.get('/', function (req, res) {
  res.send('Hello World!')
})

var server = app.listen(process.env.PORT || 3000, function () {
  var host = server.address().address
  var port = server.address().port
  console.log('App listening at http://%s:%s', host, port)
})
```

{% note %}
  The `process.env.PORT` will read the environment variable PORT dynamically provided by our container manager.
{% endnote %}

## Define How to Start Your Application

The `Procfile` (with a capital 'P') is the file defining how your application
is supposed to start ([more info about Procfile]({% post_url
platform/app/2000-01-01-procfile %})). This file must be at the root of your project.
Here is the content you have to write in the `Procfile` file for this project:

```yaml
web: node server.js
```

## Commit Your Application

```bash
$ git init
$ git add .
$ git commit -m "Base Node.js application"
```

## Create Your Application on Scalingo and Deploy

{% note %}
  This operation has to be done in the directory of your project.
{% endnote %}

```bash
$ scalingo create my-app
Git repository detected: remote scalingo added
→ 'git push scalingo master' to deploy your app

$ git push scalingo master
```

## Access Your Application

```text
…
Waiting for your application to boot...
<-- https://my-app.osc-fr1.scalingo.io -->
```

## How to Keep Your Application Alive

For Node.js apps we recommend to use a tool such as [`nodemon`](https://nodemon.io/).
