Elixir applications can be deployed on Scalingo thanks to the community buildpack:
[https://github.com/HashNuke/heroku-buildpack-elixir](https://github.com/HashNuke/heroku-buildpack-elixir). A community buildpack means that Elixir is not officially supported and minimal support is provided in case of problem with the buildpack execution.

## Elixir detection

For your Elixir app to be detected you have to declare explicitly the above
mentioned buildpack in your application's source code.
To do this, create a file named `.buildpacks` with the following content:

```bash
https://github.com/HashNuke/heroku-buildpack-elixir
```

## Configuration

In order to configure the buildpack, please add a `elixir_buildpack.config`
file at the root of the application. This file is a bash file. In order to
configure the OTP version:

```bash
erlang_version=21.2.6
```

A comprehensive list of configuration options is available
[here](https://github.com/HashNuke/heroku-buildpack-elixir#configuration).
The configuration applied by default is
[here](https://github.com/HashNuke/heroku-buildpack-elixir/blob/master/elixir_buildpack.config).

{% note %}
You should always specify your Elixir and OTP target versions. The buildpack
defaults are several versions back and may not work with your application
if you are up to date. Also note erlang OTP-24.* versions are not currently 
supported using this buildpack (most recent supported version: OTP-23.3.2).
{% endnote %}

## Phoenix Web Framework

[Phoenix](https://phoenixframework.org/) support requires combining the
[elixir buildpack mentioned above](https://github.com/HashNuke/heroku-buildpack-elixir)
and a [phoenix specific buildpack](https://github.com/gjaldon/heroku-buildpack-phoenix-static):
the first one handles compiling the Elixir code, the second one handles the assets compilation.

Create a file named `.buildpacks` in your project which will define the buildpacks to use:

```bash
https://github.com/HashNuke/heroku-buildpack-elixir
https://github.com/gjaldon/heroku-buildpack-phoenix-static
```

### Configuration

The phoenix buildpack can be configured using the `phoenix_static_buildpack.config`
file:

```bash
node_version=12.0
```

A comprehensive list of configuration options is available
[here](https://github.com/gjaldon/heroku-buildpack-phoenix-static#configuration).
The configuration applied by default is
[here](https://github.com/gjaldon/heroku-buildpack-phoenix-static/blob/master/phoenix_static_buildpack.config).


{% note %}
Here too, you should always specify your node version. The buildpack
defaults are several versions back and may not work with your application
if you are up to date.
