We support Elixir through the community buildpack for Elixir:
[https://github.com/HashNuke/heroku-buildpack-elixir](https://github.com/HashNuke/heroku-buildpack-elixir).

## Prerequisite

In order to use this buildpack, you should add the following environment variable to your application:

```
BUILDPACK_URL=https://github.com/HashNuke/heroku-buildpack-elixir
```

## Configuration

In order to configure the buildpack, please add a `elixir_buildpack.config`
file at the root of the application. This file is a bash file. In order to
configure the OTP version:

```bash
erlang_version=21.2.6
```

A comprehensive list of configuration options is available
[here](https://github.com/HashNuke/heroku-buildpack-elixir#configuration){:target="_blank"}.
