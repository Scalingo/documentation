For various reasons your application can terminate abruptly. Two cases of crash may happen:

## Boot errors

They are detected directly when you deploy your application, if it crashes
before binding the allocated network port, your deployment would fail.

> The former version of your application __keeps running__.

## Runtime crashes

Two situations are the most common causes of runtime crashes:

* Runtime error of your application (uncatched exception, segfault of a library/runtime)
* Temporary error of an external resource

## Restart policy

When a runtime crash occured we automatically restart your container. If your application
stopped again in the 5 minutes after being restarted, we won't restart it directly, but
5 minutes later.

    <li>A crash which occures after 5 minutes has no effect on the cool-down</li>
  </ul>

A limit of __12__ restart operations exist, in means that after 6 hours and 30 minutes,
your application __won't be accessible anymore__ (The last cool-off duration is 1 hour).

## How do I know my app has crashed?

When such an event occured, you'll received notifications, as well as your collaborators for the concerned application. You'll receive a notification after the 2nd, 5th and 12th crashes (following the restart policy detailed previously).

That means that if your app has crashed once for a temporary reason, it will be automatically restarted, and if it does not crash anymore, you would not receive an email, but if it crashes in a loop, you'll get a notification in the minute.

You'll also find the 'crash' events in your app timeline on the dashboard.

## What to do?

We stronly advise to look at the logs of your application using the web
dashboard or by using the [CLI tool](http://cli.scalingo.com).

According to the information gathered, you should then modify your application to
fix the issues which lead to this instability.

  After a successful deployment, a manual restart, or scaling of your application, we
  cancel any queued restart job, and the cool-down time after the next crash is reseted.
