Our goal in this tutorial will be to deploy a sample TODO list application
built with Meteor and running it locally by getting the docker image.

## Requirements

Before doing this tutorial, you need to setup your environment:

  * [Install `scalingo` Command Line
    Interface]({% post_url cli/2015-09-18-command-line-tool %})
  * [Install docker](https://docs.docker.com/engine/installation/)

## Introduction

First, deploy your app on Scalingo. You should have a working
application on scalingo. Here we will use our [meteor todo list
example](https://github.com/Scalingo/sample-meteor-todo).

To deploy it on scalingo, just [click
here](https://my.scalingo.com/deploy?source=https://github.com/johnsudaar/sample-meteor-todo)

## Get your docker image

### Add the docker-image-addon

To get the *Docker Image* of your application, you must add the
`scalingo-docker-image`. You can do it with our CLI or through your
application dashboard.

```bash
$ scalingo -a my-app addons-add scalingo-docker-image base-plan
```

Once this is done, the "Deployments" panel of your app dashboard will change,
for each successful deployment, you'll see a **Docker Logo**. Click on it to
get the instructions to download the image of a given deployment.

{% assign img_url = "https://cdn.scalingo.com/documentation/docker-image-addon/dashboard-example.png" %}
{% include mdl_img.html %}

### Login to your the Docker Registry

```bash
$ docker login registry.scalingo.com
Username: <scalingo username>
Password: <scalingo API key>
Email:    <scalingo email>
```
The API key is available on [your profile](https://my.scalingo.com/profile),
copy it from there.

### Download your image

The pull link is available on the deployment panel of your dashboard by
clicking on the **Docker logo**.

```bash
$ docker pull registry.scalingo.com/myapp:da03fc67e7c52d6
```

## Get your database image

If you are using a database with your application, you must download it from
the docker hub.

You'll need to get your database version from your database dashboard. In the
`Docker Image Version` field.

{% assign width = "350px" %}
{% assign img_url = "https://cdn.scalingo.com/documentation/docker-image-addon/database-addon.png" %}
{% include mdl_img.html %}

In our case, we are using Mongodb on version `3.2.6-2`. To download the image
you can use the docker official repository:

```bash
docker pull scalingo/<database-type>:<databse-version>
```

For this app:

```bash
docker pull scalingo/mongo:3.2.6-2
```

## Launch your application

Once you've donloaded all the needed images, you must run them on your system.

### Run the database image

To run pour database image you need to have a folder which will be used to
store your database data. Here we will be using `/var/scalingo/my-app/mongo`.

To launch the DB image type:

```bash
docke run \
  --name=<container-name> \
  -v /var/scalingo/my-app/mongo:/var/lib/<database-version> \
  scalingo/<database-type>:<database-version> \
  /mongo <user> <password> <admin_password>
```

The `user` and `password` can be set to anything. Just keep them for the next
step. The `container-name` is a name that will be used for your database
container.

In our case:

```bash
docke run -d --name=mongo_my-app \
    -v /var/scalingo/my-app/mongo:/var/lib/mongodb \
    scalingo/mongo:3.2.6-2 \
    /mongo my-app password adminpassword
```

### Run the application image

To run the application image you must:

* Link it with the database image
* Set the needed environment variables
* Expose the listening port

The general command is:

```bash
$ scalingo run \
  -e MY_ENVIRONMENT_VARIBLE=SOME_VALUE \
  -p EXPOSED_PORT:EXPOSED_PORT \
  --link MY_DATABASE_CONTAINER:NAME \
  registry.scalingo.com/<image_name> \
  /start container-type
```

In this example we need to set the `PORT` environment variable to 4000 and
expose this port to our host computer.

Since it's a meteor application, we need to set the `ROOT_URL` environment
variable to `http://localhost:4000`

```bash
$ scalingo run \
  -e PORT=4000 \
  -e ROOT_URL=http://localhost:4000 \
  -e MONGO_URL=mongo://my-app:password@mongo/my-app \
  -p 4000:4000 \
  --link mongo_my-app:mongo \
  registry.scalingo.commyapp:da03fc67e7c52d6/ /start web
```

That's it, the exact identical application running on Scalingo is running on
your workstation: [http://localhost:4000](http://localhost:4000). You want to
copy your database data from your production app, have a look at our [database
addons]({% post_url databases/2014-11-24-databases %}) documentation.
