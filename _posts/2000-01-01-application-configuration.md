According to [12 factor](https://12factor.net/) the configuration of your app should be done through environment variables. Scalingo tries to adhere to 12factor as much as possible. Read the [environment page]({% post_url configuration/2000-01-01-environment %}) to lear how to configure your app's environment variables.

If you'd like to specify how your app is booting on Scalingo, take a look at our support of the [Procfile]({% post_url configuration/2000-01-01-procfile %}).

You can then go further and define [custom domain names](configuration/2000-01-01-domain) for your apps.
