### Setup a Deployment Pipeline

On Codeship:

2. Add a new deployment pipeline by choosing the branch you want to deploy from.
3. Choose **Custom Script** deployment type.
4. Fill the deployment commands:

```bash
git fetch --unshallow || true
git push --force git@scalingo.com:my-app.git ${CI_COMMIT_ID}:master
```

Or you can use the [deployments/git_push.sh](https://github.com/codeship/scripts/blob/master/deployments/git_push.sh) script provided by Codeship.

### SSH Keys
