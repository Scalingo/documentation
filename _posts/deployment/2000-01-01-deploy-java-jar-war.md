For JVM-based web applications, instead of deploying the code by building the
code a pre-built autonomous JAR archive or WAR build can be directly deployed
on the platform.

It can be especially useful when using a Continuous Integration platform like
*TravisCI* or *Jenkins*. These platforms are usually building the project to
execute the application test suites against it. Instead of building a second
time the application code, the JAR and WAR archives generated during the build
can be directly deployed on Scalingo.

## Install Scalingo CLI

JAR and WAR archives can be deployed using the platform command line interface, first
step is to install it: [CLI Documentation]({% post_url cli/2015-09-18-command-line-tool %})

## Usage of the `deploy` command

The following example applies for **WAR** archives but **also for autonomous JAR**
archives:

```sh
$ scalingo --app my-app deploy ./application.war
-----> Deploying WAR archive: ./application.war
-----> Uploading archiveâ€¦
       Deployment started, streaming output:

[LOG] Fetching source code
[LOG] Fetching deployment cache
[LOG] -----> Installing JDK 1.8... done
[LOG]
[LOG] -----> Build complete, uploading deployment cache.
[LOG]  Build complete, shipping your container...
[LOG]  Waiting for your application to boot...
[LOG] <-- https://my-app.scalingo.io -->
```

## Configuration

### JVM version selection

The used version of OpenJDK (Java runtime) can be defined by the environment
variable `JAVA_VERSION`. By default the **1.8** version will be used.

```sh
# Configure the application to use OpenJDK version 1.9

$ scalingo --app my-app env-set JAVA_VERSION=1.9
```

### Webapp Runner / Tomcat version selection

By default, Tomcat 8.5 is installed with the last version of the webapp-runner,
if you want to use another version, you can defined the environment variable
`WEBAPP_RUNNER_VERSION`. You can find all the available versions
[here](https://github.com/jsimone/webapp-runner/releases).

The 8.0.x versions are installing Tomcat 8, and the 8.5.x releases are
installing Tomcat 8.5:

```sh
# Install Tomcat 8

$ scalingo env-set WEBAPP_RUNNER_VERSION=8.0.39.0
```
