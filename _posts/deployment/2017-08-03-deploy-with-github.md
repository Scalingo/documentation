To deploy with GitHub you'll have to create a new application on Scalingo and link it to a GitHub repository and branch.

## Link your app to GitHub

In the section Code in your Dashboard, you'll find a category *Deploy with GitHub*. Please click on `Link this app to GitHub` and check you are in the right account, choose your GitHub user, and find your GitHub repo in the list or with the searchbar.

In order to link your Scalingo app to a GitHub repo, GitHub will prompt for your authorization. You must accept for our GitHub integration to work.

Once your repo is linked, you'll be able to choose select the branch that you want to deploy and if you want to deploy automatically (*Auto deploy*) or manually (*Manual deploy*).

## Auto deploy

With Auto deploy Enabled, your application will be updated each time you'll push on your GitHub repo.

## Manual deploy

You can trigger a manual deployment by going to the "Manual deploy" section and choose the branch to deploy.

## Review apps

Review apps are special [child apps]({% post_url app/2017-03-10-child-apps %}) linked to a GitHub pull request.

Review apps can be created automatically every time a pull request is opened or they can be created manually by selecting the Pull Request to deploy among the currently opened ones (our Pull Request viewer will help you with this).

By default Review Apps are automatically destroyed when the pull request is closed. But you can specify a duration after which the Review App is destroyed.

For more information, you can read the more specific documentation pages [GitHub integration, Auto Deploy and Review Apps]({% post_url integrations/2000-01-01-github-integration %}) and [Review apps]({% post_url integrations/2017-03-10-review-apps %}).

## Some suggestions

You can also create a [child app]({% post_url app/2017-03-10-child-apps %}) which is not a review app.
