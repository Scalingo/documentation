### Dependencies Installation

Scalingo installs the dependencies Go application using [Go Modules]({% post_url languages/go/2000-01-01-gomod %}).

#### Private Dependencies

Here is how to use a dependency in a private repository for your application.

The platform looks for environment variables that follow the following pattern:
`GO_GIT_CRED__<PROTOCOL>__<HOSTNAME>`.  Any periods (`.`) in the `HOSTNAME` must
be replaces with double underscores (`__`).

The value of a matching var will be used as the username. If the value contains
a ":", the value will be split on the ":" and the left side will be used as the
username and the right side used as the password. When no password is present,
`x-oauth-basic` is used.

The following example will cause git to use the `FakePersonalAccessTokenHere` as
the username when authenticating to `github.com` via `https`:

```console
$ scalingo env-set GO_GIT_CRED__HTTPS__GITHUB__COM=FakePersoalAccessTokenHere
```

### Defining a `Procfile`

```yaml
web: <base package name>
```

Example if your package is `github.com/user/example`:

```yaml
web: example
```

### Pre/Post Compile Hooks

If the file `bin/go-pre-compile` exists and is executable, it will be executed before compilation.

Likewise, if the file `bin/go-post-compile` exists and is executable, it will be executed after the compilation.

Because the buildpack installs compiled executables to `bin`, the
`go-post-compile` hook can be written in Go if it's installed by the specified
[`<packagespec>`]({% post_url languages/go/2000-01-01-gomod %}).
