For sending emails from your PHP application you will need to send via an external SMTP server.
Several options are listed on our [dedicated section]({% post_url platform/app/2000-01-01-sending-emails %}).

You can use a mailing library such as [PHPMailer](https://github.com/PHPMailer/PHPMailer) (or equivalent) to send from
your PHP application via an external SMTP server.
