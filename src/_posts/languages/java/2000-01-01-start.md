Java is officially supported on Scalingo

## Java Versions

### Availability

The following Java versions are available:

| Java SE Version | scalingo-20       | scalingo-22       |
| --------------: | ----------------: | ----------------: |
| **`23`**        | up to `23.0.1`    | up to `23.0.1`    |

| **`13`**        | up to `13.0.14`   | up to `13.0.14`   |
| **`11 (LTS)`**  | up to `11.0.25`   | up to `11.0.24`   |
| **`10`**        | up to `10.0.2`    | up to `10.0.2`    |
| **`8 (LTS)`**   | up to `1.8.0_432` | up to `1.8.0_432` |
| **`7`**         | up to `1.7.0_352` | up to `1.7.0_352` |

For Java SE 7 and 8, the JDK versions are respectively numbered `1.7` and
`1.8`.

{% note %}
Even though we still support them, we strongly advise against using deprecated
versions of Java, such as 1.7.x or 1.8.x. If you are still using one of these
deprecated versions, please consider migrating to a more recent version.
{% endnote %}

### Selecting a Version

The default Java version on both `scalingo-20` and `scalingo-22` is the latest
`1.8`. You can, however, instruct the platform to use another version.

To do so, specify the version number in a file called `system.properties`,
which must be stored at the root of the project directory, like so:

```text
java.runtime.version=<version>
```

Please replace `<version>` with the actual number you want. For example, to
install the latest version of OpenJDK 15:

```text
java.runtime.version=15
```


## Frameworks

Most frameworks should work on the platform, the only condition is to listen on the port
defined by the environment variable `PORT`

* Spring Boot: You can find custom information about this framework at the
  [following page]({% post_url languages/java/2000-01-01-spring-boot %})

## Languages Using the JVM

Even though the Java Virtual Machine (JVM) was initially designed to execute
program developed with Java, a lot of new languages have been developed to
be executed on it. Most of them should work on Scalingo. Here are examples of
such languages known to work on Scalingo:

* Scala: see the specific documentation page [here]({% post_url languages/scala/2000-01-01-start %}).
* Groovy: see the specific documentation page [here]({% post_url languages/groovy/2000-01-01-start %}).
* Clojure: see the specific documentation page [here]({% post_url languages/clojure/2000-01-01-start %}).
* Kotlin: see the sample deployed [here](https://kotlin.is-easy-on-scalingo.com/), and [the source code](https://github.com/Scalingo/sample-kotlin).

## Deployment

It uses Maven 3.9.4 to build your application and OpenJDK 1.8 to run it (by
default).

Example usage:

```bash
$ ls
Procfile  pom.xml  src

$ scalingo create my-app

$ git push scalingo master
...
-----> Java app detected
-----> Installing OpenJDK 1.8... done
-----> Installing Maven 3.3.9... done
-----> Installing settings.xml... done
-----> executing /app/tmp/repo.git/.cache/.maven/bin/mvn -B -Duser.home=/tmp/build_19z6l4hp57wqm -Dmaven.repo.local=/app/tmp/repo.git/.cache/.m2/repository -s /app/tmp/repo.git/.cache/.m2/settings.xml -DskipTests=true clean install
       [INFO] Scanning for projects...
       [INFO]
       [INFO] ------------------------------------------------------------------------
       [INFO] Building readmeTest 1.0-SNAPSHOT
       [INFO] ------------------------------------------------------------------------
...
```

The buildpack will detect your app as Java if it has the file `pom.xml` in the
root. It will use Maven to execute the build defined by your `pom.xml` and
download your dependencies.

If your build results in a `.war` file you need to add a small dependency to
your project in order to execute it. Just [follow the guide]({% post_url
languages/java/2000-01-01-war %}).

The `.m2` folder (local maven repository) will be cached between builds for
faster dependency resolution. However neither the `mvn` executable nor the
`.m2` folder will be available in your slug at runtime.

## Configuration

### Default JVM Configuration

By default the `-Xmx` configuration of the JVM depends on the size of container
you selected for your application:

| Container Size | Maximum Heap Size (MB)                |
| -------------: | ------------------------------------: |
| S              | `160`                                 |
| M              | `300`                                 |
| L              | `671`                                 |
| XL             | `1536`                                |
| 2XL and above  | ~80% of the RAM allocated in the plan |

### Choose a Maven Version

The `system.properties` file also allows for `maven.version` entry
(regardless of whether you specify a `java.runtime.version` entry). For example:

```text
java.runtime.version=14
maven.version=3.2.5
```

Supported versions of Maven are:
- 3.0.5
- 3.1.1
- 3.2.5
- 3.3.9
- 3.5.4
- 3.6.2
- 3.9.4

You can request new versions of Maven by submitting a pull request to the [Java
buildpack](https://github.com/Scalingo/java-buildpack) against the
`lib/common.sh` file.

### Customize Maven

There are two environment variables that can be used to customize the Maven execution:

+ `MAVEN_CUSTOM_GOALS`: set to `clean install` by default
+ `MAVEN_CUSTOM_OPTS`: set to `-DskipTests=true` by default

These variables can be set like this:

```bash
$ scalingo env-set MAVEN_CUSTOM_GOALS="clean package"
$ scalingo env-set MAVEN_CUSTOM_OPTS="--update-snapshots -DskipTests=true"
```

Other options are available for [defining custom a `settings.xml`
file](https://devcenter.heroku.com/articles/using-a-custom-maven-settings-xml).

### Installation of JDK only (no Maven)

Your application may need to have the JDK/JVM only and not installing any dependency,
in this case you should use the [multi-buildpack]({% post_url platform/deployment/buildpacks/2000-01-01-multi %}).
The `.buildpacks` file lists the buildpacks you need to use, it has to look like:

```
https://github.com/Scalingo/buildpack-jvm-common
[Your second buildpack]
```

The role of the JVM Common buildpack to install it according to the
`system.properties` file as mentionned above in this page.

### Add a custom CA to Java Keychain

You may need to add one or multiple custom certificates to your JDK's Keychain.
You need to [download Scalingo default JDK
cacerts](https://cdn.scalingo.com/documentation/jdk/cacerts), then add the
custom certificates you'd like to add with the following command:

```
keytool -import -keystore cacerts -file custom.cer
```

Then create the following directory in your application
`.jdk-overlay/jre/lib/security/` and move the `cacerts` keystore file to it.
Add it to your repository, and that's it! Your custom CAs will be taken into
account.
