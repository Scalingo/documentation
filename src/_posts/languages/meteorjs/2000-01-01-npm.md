## Initialization

{% warning %}
This page is no longer valid for Meteor 1.3, see the [migration
guide](https://guide.meteor.com/1.3-migration.html){:target="_blank"}.
{% endwarning %}

### Install the package meteorhacks:npm

```bash
$ meteor add meteorhacks:npm

Changes to your project's package version selections:

meteorhacks:async  added, version 1.0.0
meteorhacks:npm    added, version 1.2.2
```

### Run the project to initialize the module

```bash
$ meteor
[[[[[ ~/path/to/app ]]]]]

=> Started proxy.
=> Started MongoDB.
   Loading plugin `initializing-npm-supp...  |

-> creating `packages.json` for the first time.
-> add your npm modules to `packages.json`

=> Creating container package for npm modules

-> npm support has been initialized.
-> please start your app again.
```

### Re-run the project to define the version

```bash
$ meteor
[[[[[ ~/path/to/app ]]]]]

=> Started proxy.
=> Started MongoDB.

Changes to your project's package version selections:

npm-container added, version 1.0.0

=> Started your app.

=> App running at: http://localhost:3000/
```

At that point your application is initialized to install and deploy custom
npm modules by adding them to the `packages.json` file at the root of your
project.

## Deployment

Once the application has been initialized, different steps are required to
ensure the application will be deployed correctly.

* Add  the `npm-container` package to your project

```bash
$ echo 'npm-container' >> .meteor/packages
```

* Check in your Git repository all the generated files.

```bash
$ git add -f packages/npm-container .meteor/packages .meteor/versions packages.json
$ git commit -m "Add npm package handling"
```

That's it, all the required files are staged for commit:

```bash
$ git push scalingo master
```

## Common errors:

### npm support has been initialized

#### Complete message

```bash
  => Creating container package for npm modules

  -> npm support has been initialized.
  -> please start your app again.
  This command has been deprecated in favor of 'meteor build', which allows you
  to build for multiple platforms and outputs a directory instead of a single
  tarball. See 'meteor help build'for more information.
  meteor bundle generation complete.
  Finding dependencies...

fs.js:666
  return binding.readdir(pathModule._makeLong(path));
                 ^
```

#### Solution

Ensure that all the steps in the [deployment](#deployment) part have been done,
this error is directly linked to an oblivion of checking in
`packages/npm-container` to the Git repository and adding `npm-container` in
the `.meteor/packages` file.

### Unknown package: npm-container

#### Complete message

```bash
Could not resolve the specified constraints for this project:
Error: unknown package: npm-container
```

#### Solution

This error is due to the fact that the package `npm-container` is present in
the `.meteor/packages` file but that the directory `packages/npm-container` has
not been added correctly to the Git repository. Please ensure this point.

### error: couldn't read npm version lock information

#### Complete message

```bash
=> Errors while initializing project:

While building package npm-container:
error: couldn't read npm version lock information
```

### Solution

This error happened when the internal files of `npm-container` are already defined
and that you've added or updated a npm package in your project. To fix this you have
to remove these data from your Git repository

```bash
git rm -r --cached packages/npm-container/.npm
echo packages/npm-container/.npm >> .gitignore
git commit -m "remove internal data of npm-container from repository"
git push scalingo master
```

That should do the trick and your application will be deployed correctly.
