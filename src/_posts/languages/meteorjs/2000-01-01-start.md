Meteor is a complete open source platform for building web and mobile apps in
pure JavaScript. It focuses problematics around real time web to emphasize the
most fluent experience possible.

## Getting Started Tutorial

Deploy your first __Meteor__ application: [follow the guide]({% post_url
languages/meteorjs/2000-01-01-start %})

Deploy an existing application like __Telescope__: [follow the guide]({%
post_url languages/meteorjs/2000-01-01-telescope %})

## Meteor App Detection

The directory `.meteor` should be present at the root of your project

## Meteor Dependencies Installation

* Using Meteor embedded dependency management (with `meteor add` and `meteor
  update`)
* Using `npm` package manager (with `meteor npm <command>`)

## Node and npm Versions

If defined, Node.js version and npm version are read from the `engines` section of the `package.json` file. If no version is defined, we'll install the latest stable version compatible with your Meteor application.

```json
{
  "name": "myapp",
  "engines": {
    "node": "4.8.x",
    "npm": "3.x"
  }
}
```

| Meteor  |  Node.js   |   npm   |  yarn  |
| ------- | ---------- | ------- |--------|
| >= 2.3  |  14.17.x   |  6.x    |  1.x   |
| 2.2     |  12.22.x   |  6.x    |  1.x   |
| 2.1     |  12.22.x   |  6.x    |  1.x   |
| 2.0     |  12.20.x   |  6.x    |  1.x   |
| 1.12    |  12.16.x   |  6.x    |  1.x   |
| 1.10    |  12.16.x   |  6.x    |  1.x   |
| 1.8     |  8.16.x    |  6.x    |  1.x   |
| 1.6     |  8.8.x     |  5.x    |  1.x  |
| 1.5     |  4.8.x     |  4.6.x  |  n/a   |
| 1.4     |  4.8.x     |  4.6.x  |  n/a   |
| <= 1.3  |  0.10.x    |  3.x    |  n/a   |


## Meteor App Startup

A script named `.start-meteor-app` is automatically generated after the build of your application. Its role is to start correctly your application.

Generated `.start-meteor-app`:

```yaml
cd .app-build/bundle/programs/server
exec node boot.js program.json
```

The buildpack also generates a `.release` file

```yaml
default_process_types:
  web: ./.start-meteor-app
```

If no `Procfile` exists, the web type of the `.release` will be executed by
default.  If your wish to write your own `Procfile` don't forget to keep this
line for your `web` process, otherwise your application may not boot.

## Configuration

### Meteor Settings

If you have a `settings.json` or a `config/settings.json` file that you usually
run with `meteor --settings settings.json`, you have nothing to do. It will be
handled by our deployment system, **but this method is deprecated**.

Storing configuration data like credentials in a file present in your Git
repository is not recommended. We advise you to use the environment variable
`METEOR_SETTINGS`, the variable is automatically read by Meteor and it stays
out of your code repository. You have to set the content of this [environment
variable]({% post_url platform/app/2000-01-01-environment %}) (with our CLI or through
your web dashboard) to match the content of your `settings.json` file.
Furthermore, using this method allows you to manage easily multiple environment
of the same app.

If you're using a `settings.json` file, here is the method to migrate to an environment-based
setup:

```bash
$ echo 'settings.json' >> .gitignore
$ git rm --cached settings.json
$ git add .gitignore
$ git commit -m "Add settings file to gitignore to avoid having credentials in code"
$ scalingo env-set METEOR_SETTINGS="$(cat settings.json)"
$ git push scalingo master
```

### Custom Timezone

The default timezone of your containers is UTC. You can set it to a different value by setting the
environment variable `TZ` with the desired timezone:

```
scalingo --app my-app env-set TZ=Europe/Paris
```

A list of existing timezones is available
[here](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_tz_database_time_zones#List){:target="_blank"}.

### Built-In Mobile Integration

If you need to use your application as a backend for your *Android* or *iOS*
application, don't worry. It is **done by default by the platform**. You need
to use **Meteor ≥ 1.3**, if that's the case, [the flag
`--server-only`](https://guide.meteor.com/mobile.html#building-for-production)
will be used to build your app. Finally, your mobile apps will be able to communicate
with it without any problem.

### Debug Build

By default, Meteor minify all your assets to stand in one single JavaScript
file, if you want to make a 'debug' build (assets un-minified), please define
the following environment variable:

```bash
scalingo env-set METEOR_DEBUG_BUILD=true
```

{% warning %}
Do not enable debug builds with an application in production. It would allow
any user to enable the **Autopublish** development feature of Meteor, which
would allow anyone to get access to **any data from the application database**.
This feature is designed to debug application build and application runtime use
it only in staging/pre-production environments.
{% endwarning %}>

## How to Scale __Meteor__

As a real time framework, the number of scaling constraints is higher than another more classical
framework. Each instance is keeping some stateful information and each instance has to be able to
get instantly the most up-to-date data. To achieve that, the two common processes used are the
_sticky sessions_ and the _oplog_ feature of MongoDB.

### Oplog

__Oplog__ is a MongoDB feature which logs all the operations achieved on a MongoDB cluster. __Meteor__
uses this feature to sync different instances of an application.

{% note %}
  See also [Oplog Observe Driver](https://github.com/meteor/meteor/wiki/Oplog-Observe-Driver)
{% endnote %}

It can be enabled from the addon database dashboard. When activated it will automatically add the
`MONGO_OPLOG_URL` in your application. This variable name is the standard name to configure
__Meteor__.  Restart your application for this variable to be taken into account.

![Link to Dashboard](/assets/images/database/link-to-dashboard.png)

{% note %}
  This operation will restart your database instance so your application may raise an exception.
{% endnote %}

### Sticky Sessions

{% note %}
  The usage of _sticky sessions_ is also known as _session affinity_
{% endnote %}

Session affinity is the process of saving on which instance a given user has been routed, in order
to use this route again for a given time. Our load balancers have _sticky sessions_ enabled
automatically for __Meteor__ apps. A user will keep using the same route during 1 hour.

You have nothing to do except increasing the amount of containers you are using. To do so, open the
dashboard of your application, and in the _containers_ tab increase the amount of needed containers.
Click on _scale_ and the amount of instances will be scaled instantly.

## Basic Authentication

If you want to setup basic authentication in front of your app, you can use the
[kit:basic-auth](https://atmospherejs.com/kit/basic-auth) package.

## Buildpack

The deployment of Meteor application is handled by our [Node.js
Buildpack](https://github.com/Scalingo/nodejs-buildpack) which has been modified to manage
particularly Meteor application.

1. It detects Meteor application
2. Choose the good Node.js version
3. Install Meteor runtime
4. Build project
5. Prepare runtime environment
