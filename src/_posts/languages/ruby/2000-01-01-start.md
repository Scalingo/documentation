Ruby is officially supported by Scalingo. Furthermore, custom support is added
for the Rails framework in all its versions.

* [Getting Started with Rails]({% post_url languages/ruby/rails/2000-01-01-start %})

## Buildpack

The buildpack is based on Bundler and will install the dependencies defined in
the `Gemfile` and `Gemfile.lock` of your project ([source of the
buildpack](https://github.com/Scalingo/ruby-buildpack)).

## Ruby Application

Presence of a `Gemfile`

## Rack Based Application

Presence of a `config.ru`

### Rack Environment

When a Rack application is detected, the following environment variable will
automatically be set by the platform:

* `RACK_ENV=production`

## Rails Application

### Rails Application Detection

Scalingo automatically detects the use of Rails, whatever the version used. All Rails versions are supported.

Starting with Rails 5.1, `node` and `yarn` will be automatically installed if the gem `webpacker` is installed.

### Rails Environment

When a Rails application is detected, the following environment variables will
automatically be set by the platform:

* `RACK_ENV=production`
* `RAILS_ENV=production`

## Bundler Version

The buildpack installs a version of Bundler based on the major and minor
version listed in the `Gemfile.lock` file, under the `BUNDLED WITH` key:

| `BUNDLED WITH` | Bundler Version | Req. Ruby Version |
| -------------- | --------------- | ----------------- |
| **`4.0.x`**    | `4.0.0`         | >= `3.2.0`        |
| **`2.7.x`**    | `2.7.2`         | >= `3.1.0`        |
| **`2.6.x`**    | `2.6.9`         | >= `3.1.0`        |
| **`2.5.x`**    | `2.5.23`        | >= `3.0.0`        |
| **`2.4.x`**    | `2.4.22`        | >= `2.6.0`        |
| **`2.3.x`**    | `2.3.25`        | >= `2.3.0`        |

If your application fails to boot with the following error logs:

```
Activating bundler (2.0.1) failed:
Could not find 'bundler' (2.0.1) required by your /app/Gemfile.lock.
```

It means you need to update bundler in your project:

```
$ gem update bundler
$ bundle update --bundler
$ git add Gemfile.lock
$ git commit -m "Update bundler to new version"
$ git push scalingo master
```

## Ruby Versions

### Availability

| Ruby Version | `scalingo-20` (EOL) | `scalingo-22`   | `scalingo-24`   |
| ------------ | ------------------- | --------------- | --------------- |
| **`4.0`**    | Unavailable         | up to `4.0.1`   | up to `4.0.1`   |

{% include scalingo_20_deprecation_note.md %}

### Select a Version

The default Ruby version on all stacks is the latest **`3.3`** version.
If you need to install another version, specify it in your `Gemfile`,
using the `ruby` keyword. For example, to install Ruby `3.4.3`:

```ruby
ruby "3.4.3"
```


## Ruby Application Web Server

Ruby contains a default application web server named `WEBrick`. As it is always
present, most web framework use it by default. It's good enough in development,
but it has never been thought to be a production server.

## Do not use WEBrick

WEBrick has the following characteristics:

* Single threaded
* Single process

It can't handle several request in parallel, they are all in a single request
queue. As a result, very poor performance can be expected. To get the best of
your containers, you need to use a real production-ready application server.

## Using Puma as a Production Server

To handle several requests in parallel, we recommend [puma](https://puma.io).
To use it, add it as dependency in your `Gemfile`:

```text
gem 'puma'
```

And configure how to launch your app by defining a `Procfile`:

```yaml
web: bundle exec puma -C config/puma.rb
```

The configuration file looks like the following:

```ruby
workers Integer(ENV['WEB_CONCURRENCY'] || 2)
threads_count = Integer(ENV['MAX_THREADS'] || 3)
threads threads_count, threads_count

preload_app!

rackup      DefaultRackup
port        ENV['PORT']     || 3000
environment ENV['RACK_ENV'] || 'development'

on_worker_boot do
  # Worker specific setup for Rails 4.1+
  ActiveRecord::Base.establish_connection
end
```

With these settings, you can change the number of web workers and threads by defining
the `WEB_CONCURRENCY` and `MAX_THREADS` environment variables and restarting your app.


## WEB_CONCURRENCY

The default level of concurrency is automatically defined, depending on the
amount of memory available in the container running the app:

| Container Size | Memory (MB) | Default Concurrency |
| -------------: | ----------: |-------------------: |
| S              | 256         | 1                   |
| M              | 512         | 1                   |
| L              | 1024        | 2                   |
| XL             | 2048        | 2                   |
| 2XL            | 4096        | 4                   |

For further details about this calculation, please see the
[`lib/language_pack/ruby.rb`][web_concurrency_file] file of the Ruby buildpack.

To override the automatically defined value, set the `WEB_CONCURRENCY`
environment variable to the desired value.
