The Redis® database is often use for cache purpose with Rails deployments. Hence you might want to clear 
its content after
each deployment. One solution could be to empty it in a [postdeploy hook]({% post_url
platform/app/2000-01-01-postdeploy-hook %}). Another solution can be to prefix the cache key with
the build deployment ID provided by Scalingo.

The deployment ID is available in the `SOURCE_VERSION` during the build phase and
`CONTAINER_VERSION` at runtime. More information about these [variables]({% post_url
platform/app/2000-01-01-environment %}).

With Ruby on Rails, configuring such cache is done using this single line:

```ruby
config.cache_store = :redis_cache_store, {
    url: "#{ ENV['REDIS_URL'] }/0:#{ ENV['SOURCE_VERSION'] || ENV['CONTAINER_VERSION'] }"
}
```

By default, Scalingo for Redis® databases have a [timeout]({% post_url databases/redis/2000-01-01-start %}#idle-connections-timeout).

If you don't want to depend on the timeout of the server, you may want to
change the client connection timeout. You can do it like this:
```ruby
config.cache_store = :redis_cache_store, {
    url: "#{ ENV['REDIS_URL'] }/0:#{ ENV['SOURCE_VERSION'] || ENV['CONTAINER_VERSION'] }",
    connect_timeout: 1,
    read_timeout: 1,
    write_timeout: 1
}
```

If you want an automatic reconnection after the connection timed out,
you should set the `reconnect_attempts` option:
```ruby
config.cache_store = :redis_cache_store, {
    url: "#{ ENV['REDIS_URL'] }/0:#{ ENV['SOURCE_VERSION'] || ENV['CONTAINER_VERSION'] }",
    connect_timeout: 1,
    read_timeout: 1,
    write_timeout: 1,
    reconnect_attempts: 1
}
```

This simple trick will automatically invalidate the cache after each successful deployment. You'd certainly also want to enable Redis® *cache mode* on its Dashboard on Scalingo to avoid filling your Redis® database completely and tell Redis® to drop old and unused keys.
