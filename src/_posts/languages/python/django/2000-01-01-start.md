## Initialize Your Application

```bash
# Create your project
mkdir my-project
cd my-project

# Create a virtualenv
virtualenv venv
source venv/bin/activate

# Install Django toolbelt
pip install django-toolbelt

# Initialize Django project, this command will
# create a manage.py file and a myapp directory
django-admin.py startproject myapp .
```

## Define How To Start Your Application

By default, the platform is looking for the web process type to start. You need to specify how to start the applicative server, and define it to display logs on `stdout` to fit the [12-factor](http://12factor.net/) principles.

### Using a WSGI Server

Create a file named `Procfile` at the root of the project containing:

```yaml
web: gunicorn myapp.wsgi --log-file -
```

### Using a ASGI Server

In order to make use of a ASGI server such as Uvicorn, create a file named `Procfile` at the root of the project containing:

```yaml
web: gunicorn myapp.asgi --worker-class=uvicorn.workers.UvicornWorker --log-file -
```

## Compile `.mo` Message Translation File

If you are using `compilemessages` command to generate `.mo` file for gettext
translations, that command needs to run before starting Gunicorn.

A solution would be to write a short start script (e.g. `bin/start.sh`):

```sh
#!/bin/bash

python manage.py compilemessages
gunicorn myapp.wsgi --log-file -
```

Then in your `Procfile`, directly call this script:

```
web: bash bin/start.sh
```

For more details, check the documentation about [Procfile]({% post_url platform/app/2000-01-01-procfile %}).


## Python App Recognition and Dependencies Definition

The platform will understand that your app is a __Python__ application if it
contains a `requirements.txt` file at the root of the project. To create it,
your have to run the following command:

```bash
pip freeze > requirements.txt
```

## Create Your Application and Databases on Scalingo

{% note %}
  You can also use our web dashboard to achieve this operation
{% endnote %}

```bash
$ scalingo create myapp
```

* Go on the [dashboard](https://my.scalingo.com/apps) of your application.
* Select the __Addons__ category
* Choose the database you want to use

### PostgreSQL

Nothing to do

### MySQL

By default, only the PostgreSQL driver is installed, you need to replace
it by the MySQL driver.

```bash
pip uninstall psycopg2
pip install mysqlclient
pip freeze > requirements.txt
```

## Application Configuration

The configuration of the application has to be done through the environment
variables, no credentials should be present statically in the code. It is
usually a bad practice.

The configuration file in our example is located at `myapp/settings.py`.

### Ensure That the Base Directory of the Application Is Defined

{% note %}
  This instruction may be already set according to your Django version
{% endnote %}

Add (if not already set) the following definition after the top comment header
of the `myapp/settings.py` file:

```python
import os
BASE_DIR = os.path.dirname(os.path.dirname(__file__))
```

### Configure the Database Access

Still in the `myapp/settings.py`, replace:

```python
DATABASES = {
    'default': {
        'ENGINE': 'django.db.backends.sqlite3',
        'NAME': os.path.join(BASE_DIR, 'db.sqlite3'),
    }
}
```

With:

```python
import dj_database_url

try:
  database_url = os.environ["DATABASE_URL"]
except KeyError:
  database_url = "file:///{}".format(os.path.join(BASE_DIR, 'db.sqlite3'))

DATABASES = { 'default': dj_database_url.config() }
```

This has no effect on the default behavior. If no `DATABASE_URL` has been set,
the application will fallback on your development backend, sqlite3. However, we
advise you to use the same database in development and in production to ensure
bug free migrations.

### Static File Serving

In your settings configuration file `myapp/settings.py`:

```python
STATIC_ROOT = 'staticfiles'
STATIC_URL = '/static/'

STATICFILES_DIRS = (
    os.path.join(BASE_DIR, 'static'),
)
```

In the `myapp/wsgi.py` file, replace

```python
from django.core.wsgi import get_wsgi_application
application = get_wsgi_application()
```

With

```python
from django.core.wsgi import get_wsgi_application
from dj_static import Cling

application = Cling(get_wsgi_application())
```

`Cling` is part of the `dj_static` module and is designed to serve static files.

If you don't need to serve static files, you can setup the following environment variable:

```text
DISABLE_COLLECTSTATIC=1
```

It will be taken into account during the next deployment of your application.

### Configuration of Allowed Hosts

By default, Django filter the allowed domain names used to access the application. Without specifying them, you'll get the following error:

```
> Invalid HTTP_HOST header: '<domain>'. You may need to add '<domain>' to ALLOWED_HOSTS.
```

So you need to modify the `settings.py`. Replace this static array:

```python
ALLOWED_HOSTS = ["localhost"]
```

By this dynamic block reading the environment:

```python
env_allowed_hosts = []
try:
  env_allowed_hosts = os.environ["ALLOWED_HOSTS"].split(",")
except KeyError:
  pass

ALLOWED_HOSTS = ["localhost"] + env_allowed_hosts
```

Then change the environment variable of your application with a coma-separated list of domains which will be used to access the app.

```bash
scalingo --app app-name env-set ALLOWED_HOSTS=app-name.osc-fr1.scalingo.io,example.com
```

## Save Your App With Git

### Setup `.gitignore`

You don't want to keep track of everything on your version control system. To
prevent such files to be added to Git, create the file `.gitignore` at the root
of your project with the following content:

```text
venv
*.pyc
staticfiles
```

### Commit Your Application

```bash
git init
git add .
git commit -m "Init Django application"
```

## Deploy Your Application

```bash
git remote add scalingo git@ssh.osc-fr1.scalingo.com:myapp.git
git push scalingo master
```

Note that the remote URL depends on the region of your application. You can get
it using our CLI with:

```bash
scalingo --app myapp git-show
```

## Access Your Application

```bash
…
Waiting for your application to boot...
<-- https://myapp.osc-fr1.scalingo.io -->
```
