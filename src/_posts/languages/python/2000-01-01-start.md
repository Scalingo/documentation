The Python language is officially supported on the platform.

## Detection

To ensure our deployment system considers your application as a Python
application, a file `Pipfile`, `requirements.txt` or `setup.py` should be
present at the root of your project, defining the dependencies of your app.

## Python Versions

### Availability

The following versions of Python are available:

| Python Version | scalingo-20     | scalingo-22     |
| -------------: | --------------: | --------------: |
| **`3.13`**     | up to `3.13.0`  | up to `3.13.0`  |
| **`3.12`**     | up to `3.12.7`  | up to `3.12.7`  |
| **`3.11`**     | up to `3.11.10` | up to `3.11.10` |
| **`3.10`**     | up to `3.10.15` | up to `3.10.15` |
| `3.9`          | up to `3.9.20`  | up to `3.9.20`  |
| `3.8`          | up to `3.8.20`  | unsupported     |

{% note %}
Even though we still support them, we strongly advise against using deprecated
versions of Python, such as Python `3.9.x` and below. If you are still using
one of these deprecated versions, please consider migrating to a more recent
version.
{% endnote %}

### Selecting a Version

The default Python version on both `scalingo-20` and `scalingo-22` is the
latest `3.12` version. You can, however, instruct the platform to use another
version.

The buildpack looks for a Python version in the following places (in descending
order of precedence):

- The `runtime.txt` file (deprecated)
- The `.python-version` file (recommended)
- The `python_full_version` and `python_version` fields in the `Pipfile.lock`
  file (Pipenv users only)

{% warning %}
The `runtime.txt` file is deprecated. If your app uses it, we recommend
switching to a `.python-version` file instead, since it’s more widely supported
by other tooling in the Python ecosystem.
{% endwarning %}

To instruct the platform to use a specific Python runtime, add a
`.python-version` file to your app’s root directory and declare the Python
version number to use in it.

This version can be either:

- The major Python version such as `3.12` (recommended)
- The full Python version such as `3.12.7`

{% note %}
We usually recommend to specify only a major version (such as `3.13`) so that
your app gets the latest security updates automatically.
{% endnote %}


## Dependencies

### Recommended: pipenv

When the project is using `pipenv` and contains a **Pipfile** and a
**Pipfile.lock** files, the following command is used to install dependencies:

```
pipenv install
```

### Legacy: requirements.txt

If a `requirements.txt` file is present in your application, the dependencies
will be installed respecting this file with:

```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Frameworks

We handle most of the common frameworks. Obviously, Django is among them. You need to
configure your application to bind the port defined by the environment variable `$PORT`.

## Specific Python Buildpack Hooks

You may want to trigger custom actions after a successful deployment. The [postdeploy hook]({%
post_url platform/app/2000-01-01-postdeploy-hook %}) is exactly what you need. But your
application may require some actions to be executed during the deployment.

The Python buildpack can execute two hooks: before and after the installation of Python and its
dependencies. They must be located in the `bin` root folder of your application and be named
`pre_compile` and `post_compile`.
