The Python language is officially supported on the platform.

## Detection

To ensure our deployment system considers your application as a Python
application, a file `Pipfile`, `requirements.txt` or `setup.py` should be
present at the root of your project, defining the dependencies of your app.

## Python Versions

### Availability

The following versions of Python are available:

| Python Version | scalingo-20     | scalingo-22     |
| -------------: | --------------: | --------------: |
| `3.12`         | up to `3.12.5`  | up to `3.12.5`  |
| `3.11`         | up to `3.11.9`  | up to `3.11.9`  |
| `3.10`         | up to `3.10.14` | up to `3.10.14` |
| `3.9`          | up to `3.9.19`  | up to `3.9.19`  |
| `3.8`          | up to `3.8.19`  | unsupported     |

{% note %}
Even though we still support them, we strongly advise against using deprecated
versions of Python, such as Python `3.7.x`. If you are still using one of these
deprecated versions, please consider migrating to a more recent version.
{% endnote %}

### Selecting a Version

The default Python version on both `scalingo-20` and `scalingo-22` is the
latest `3.12` version. You can, however, instruct the platform to use another
version.

#### Using `pipenv`

The preferred way to manage dependencies and python version is by using the
`pipenv` tool. When creating a project with pipenv, the Python version is
frozen in the `Pipfile` file, i.e.:

```
[requires]
python_version = "3.10"
```

The deployment system will use this information to install the last available
version respecting this constraint. In the previous example Python `3.10.13`
would be installed.

The `python_version` field only accepts minor versions of Python like `3.10` or
`3.9`.  If the project needs to use a specific Python patch (i.e.: `3.10.1`)
the Pipfile should contain a `python_full_version` field, e.g.:

```
[requires]
python_full_version = "3.10.1"
```

#### Using `runtime.txt`

You can specify the runtime version in the `runtime.txt` file at the root of
your repository.

Example of `runtime.txt` which would install Python `3.9.16`:

```text
python-3.9.16
```

## Dependencies

### Recommended: pipenv

When the project is using `pipenv` and contains a **Pipfile** and a
**Pipfile.lock** files, the following command is used to install dependencies:

```
pipenv install
```

### Legacy: requirements.txt

If a `requirements.txt` file is present in your application, the dependencies
will be installed respecting this file with:

```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Frameworks

We handle most of the common frameworks. Obviously, Django is among them. You need to
configure your application to bind the port defined by the environment variable `$PORT`.

## Specific Python Buildpack Hooks

You may want to trigger custom actions after a successful deployment. The [postdeploy hook]({%
post_url platform/app/2000-01-01-postdeploy-hook %}) is exactly what you need. But your
application may require some actions to be executed during the deployment.

The Python buildpack can execute two hooks: before and after the installation of Python and its
dependencies. They must be located in the `bin` root folder of your application and be named
`pre_compile` and `post_compile`.
