## Introduction

Sometimes, your application may need to reach an infrastructure which
is not opened to the Internet and the only way to access the services
or databases in this infrastructure are to create a VPN connection and
join the private network of this infrastructure.

This addon provides a way to create VPN connections from your application
containers using the **OpenVPN** technology.

## Setup of the Addon

### Provision the Addon

First, you need to provision the add to your application. This can be done
through the web dashboard or with our command line tool:

```bash
scalingo --app my-app addons-add scalingo-vpn-openvpn vpn-openvpn-standard
```

### Setup the Configuration

From the addon tab of your dashboard, click on the OpenVPN addon icon to reach
its dashboard. The following items can be configured:

* OpenVPN *client* Configuration file **required** (Content of the configuration file, often named `<name>.ovpn` by providers)
* CA Certificate   **required** (X.509 certificate of the Certificate Authority used to sign the server certificate)
* User Certificate **required** (X.509 certificate associated to the user)
* User Private Key **required** (private key associated to the user)
* User Private Key Passphrase **optional** (Key passphrase if the private key is encrypted)
* Username/Password **optional** (Should be filled if authentication with login/password is required)

As stated in their description, these fields should be filled according to the
OpenVPN Server configuration.

### Example

```
client
dev tun
proto tcp
remote <ip:port>
route remote_host 255.255.255.255 net_gateway
resolv-retry infinite
redirect-gateway autolocal
nobind
persist-key
persist-tun
ca ca.pem
cert cert.pem
key key.pem
auth-user-pass
cipher AES-256-CBC
auth SHA256
comp-lzo
route-delay 4
verb 3
reneg-sec 0
```

This is an example of OpenVPN configuration file. The instruction
`auth-user-pass` shows that the connection requires a couple
username/password, in this case the configuration should be correctly defined.

Once you've validated the configuration, the following environment variables
will be added to your application environment:

* `SCALINGO_OPENVPN_CONF`
* `SCALINGO_OPENVPN_CERT`
* `SCALINGO_OPENVPN_CA`
* `SCALINGO_OPENVPN_KEY`
* `SCALINGO_OPENVPN_KEY_PASS`
* `SCALINGO_OPENVPN_USERNAME`
* `SCALINGO_OPENVPN_PASSWORD`

The app will be restarted and you should see the output of the OpenVPN being setup:

## Q&A

### What happen if the connection is cut?

The OpenVPN automatically schedules reconnections, using an exponential backoff
logics (restart instantly first time, then wait longer and longer according to
the number of consecutive failures).

### Where can I find a comprehensive documentation of OpenVPN configuration files?

The [official OpenVPN wiki](https://community.openvpn.net/openvpn/wiki) contains
everything you might need to configure the OpenVPN client and server.

### What version of the OpenVPN client is available?

It depends on the stack:

* `scalingo-18`: [2.4.x](https://packages.ubuntu.com/bionic/amd64/openvpn)
* `scalingo-20`: [2.4.x](https://packages.ubuntu.com/focal/amd64/openvpn)
* `scalingo-22`: [2.5.x](https://packages.ubuntu.com/jammy/amd64/openvpn)

### I would like to configure the DNS with the `dhcp-option` configuration, is it possible?

The use of the `dhcp-option` is not possible on Scalingo. It is mandatory to use Scalingo DNS, for instance to resolve databases domain name. A solution to circumvent this limitation is to create a public domain name which resolves to a private IP address.
