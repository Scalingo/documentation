Databases are essential for storing your data. Because data should be
geographically close to the servers that use it, we support the most common
database types.

You can use our managed databases with or without hosting your applications on
Scalingo. When your apps run on Scalingo, the database is located in the same
region to provide the best performance and lowest latency.


## Service classes

Scalingo offers three ***service classes*** with distinct characteristics,
enabling you to choose the level of performance, replication, security and
price that suits your use case. All our plans are 100% managed and billed per
minute based on usage.

| Service class | SLA    | High availability   | HDS eligibility |
|---------------|--------|---------------------|-----------------|
| Starter       | 98%    | Single-node         | Not eligible    |
| Business      | 99.96% | Multi-nodes cluster | Eligible        |
| Enterprise    | 99.99% | Multi-nodes cluster | Eligible        |

You can switch service classes in a few minutes, moving from a single-node
instance to a multi-node cluster, and vice versa.

For more details, see our [Service Classes][service-classes] page.


## Architecture Models

At Scalingo, every database runs on its own dedicated instance, with isolated
data, its own engine version, and its own deployment and configuration. The
architecture model describes the infrastructure and network isolation that
host the instance.

- **Shared Resources (SR)**: Fully dedicated database instances running on
  **shared infrastructure and network**. Suitable for a wide range of
  workloads, from development and testing to production.
- **Dedicated Resources (DR)**: Fully dedicated database instance running on a
  **dedicated virtual machine and private network** (VPC). Built on
  latest-generation hardware and **SecNumCloud-ready architecture**, it is
  designed for secure, reliable, and critical workloads.

{% note %}
The Dedicated Resources architecture model is currently available on Scalingo
for PostgreSQL and for selected customers.
To request access or learn more, please contact Support or Sales teams.
