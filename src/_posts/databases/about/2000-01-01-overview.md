Scalingo Managed Databases provide fully managed, production-ready data engines, 
without the operational overhead of running your own database server. 
Provision in minutes, scale as needed, and rely on a single service that handles 
day-to-day operations so your team can focus on building and running 
applications.

You can use our managed databases independently or alongside apps hosted on 
Scalingo. When used with Scalingo apps, databases ca be deployed in the same 
region to minimise latency and keep data close to the workloads that use it.

- **Ops-free by design**: no infrastructure to run or maintain, Scalingo handles day-to-day operations.
- **Pay per minute**: usage-based pricing for predictable scaling and cost control.
- **Transparent costs**: no separate infrastructure costs (networking, storage). Everything is included.
- **High availability**: 98% to 99.99% SLA, with multi-node plans built for resilience.
- **Developer-friendly**: manage your databases from the dashboard, or automate via ou API and CLI.
- **Managed backups**: automated backups with multiple retention options.
- **Built-in observability**: monitoring and logs for fast troubleshooting.
- **One-click upgrades**: keep your database engine up to date, directly from the dashboard.
- **Security and compliance**: ISO 27001, HDS-eligible options and SecNumCloud-qualified infrastructure.
- **Hosted in Europe**: your data stays in Europe, under European jurisdiction.

Many powerful [database features][db-features] are available directly from our
[Database Dashboard][database-dashboard], with a simple and streamlined
experience.


## Database Engines

We provide the main open-source database engines used by developers for modern
application workloads.

### SQL

- [Scalingo for PostgreSQL®][postgresql]
- [Scalingo for MySQL®][mysql]

### NoSQL

- [Scalingo for OpenSearch®][opensearch]
- [Scalingo for MongoDB®][mongodb]
- [Scalingo for Caching][redis]
- [Scalingo for Elasticsearch®][elasticsearch]
- [Scalingo for InfluxDB®][influxdb]


## Architecture Models

At Scalingo, **every managed database runs on its own dedicated instance**, 
with isolated data, its own engine version, and its own deployment and 
configuration. The architecture model describes the infrastructure and network 
isolation that hosts the instance.

- **Shared Resources**: Fully dedicated database instances running on
  **shared infrastructure and network**. Suitable for a wide range of
  workloads, from development and testing to production.
- **Dedicated Resources**: Fully dedicated database instance running on a
  **dedicated virtual machine and private network**. Built on
  latest-generation hardware and **SecNumCloud-ready architecture**, it is
  designed for secure, reliable, and critical workloads.

For more details, see our [Architecture Models][architecture-models] page.

{% note %}
The Dedicated Resources architecture model is currently available for Scalingo 
for PostgreSQL® only, and only to selected customers.

## Service classes

Scalingo offers three **service classes** with distinct characteristics,
enabling you to choose the level of performance, replication, security and
price that suits your use case. All our plans are 100% managed and billed per
minute based on usage.

| Service class | SLA    | High availability   | HDS eligibility |
|---------------|--------|---------------------|-----------------|
| Starter       | 98%    | Single-node         | Not eligible    |
| Business      | 99.96% | Multi-node cluster  | Eligible        |
| Enterprise    | 99.99% | Multi-node cluster  | Eligible        |

You can switch service classes in a few minutes, moving from a single-node
instance to a multi-node cluster, and vice versa.

For more details, see our [Service Classes][service-classes] page.


## Database Plans

We offer a wide range of instance sizes across database engines, from 256 MB to
512 GB of RAM. For details, refer to the documentation for the engine you plan
to use.
