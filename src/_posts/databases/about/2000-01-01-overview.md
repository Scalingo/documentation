Databases are essential for storing your data. Because data should be
geographically close to the servers that use it, we support the most common
database types.

You can use our managed databases with or without hosting your applications on
Scalingo. When your apps run on Scalingo, the database is located in the same
region to provide the best performance and lowest latency.


## Service classes

Scalingo offers three ***service classes*** with distinct characteristics,
enabling you to choose the level of performance, replication, security and
price that suits your use case. All our plans are 100% managed and billed per
minute based on usage.

You can switch service classes in a few minutes, moving from a single-node
instance to a multi-node cluster, and vice versa.

### Starter

The Starter class is designed for applications under development and
non-critical, production environments. With an SLA of 98%, it offers a secure,
high-performance environment for a wide range of use cases.

### Business

The Business class delivers strong high availability and production-grade
resilience, which are essential for critical production applications. Thanks
to hot replication of your data on a standby instance, we ensure service
continuity along with a 99.96% SLA. It is the first service class eligible
for Health data hosting (HDS).

### Enterprise

{% note %}
The Enterprise service class is currently available to selected customers only.
To request access or learn more, please contact Support or Sales teams.

The Enterprise class delivers maximum fault tolerance and the highest SLA
expectations. Thanks to hot replication of your data on multiple standby
instances, we ensure service continuity along with a 99.99% SLA. It is
tailored for mission-critical and compliance-intensive environments.


## Database Plans

We offer a wide range of instance sizes across database engines, from 256 MB to
512 GB of RAM. For details, refer to the documentation for the engine you plan
to use.


## Architecture Models

At Scalingo, every database runs on its own dedicated instance, with isolated
data, its own engine version, and its own deployment and configuration. The
architecture model describes the infrastructure and network isolation that
host the instance.

- **Shared Resources (SR)**: Fully dedicated database instances running on
  **shared infrastructure and network**. Suitable for a wide range of
  workloads, from development and testing to production.
- **Dedicated Resources (DR)**: Fully dedicated database instance running on a
  **dedicated virtual machine and private network** (VPC). Built on
  latest-generation hardware and **SecNumCloud-ready architecture**, it is
  designed for secure, reliable, and critical workloads.

{% note %}
The Dedicated Resources architecture model is currently available on Scalingo
for PostgreSQL and for selected customers.
To request access or learn more, please contact Support or Sales teams.
