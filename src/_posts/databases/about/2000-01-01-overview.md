Your applications need databases to store your data. As we believe your data
should be located geographically close to your application servers we support
the most common types of database.

We ensure your database is located at the same location as your applications.
It provides the best performances and latency possible. Moreover you know where
your data is.

## Database Plans

Scalingo offers two ***classes*** of service with distinct characteristics,
enabling you to choose the level of performance, replication, security and
price that suits your use case. All our plans are 100% managed and billed on
demand.

You can **seamlessly** switch between plans and service classes in just a few
seconds, from the smallest single-node instance plan to the largest multi-node
cluster plan, and everything in between.

### Starter

The Starter class is designed for applications under development and
non-critical, production environments. With an SLA of 98% and back-up retention
of one month, it offers a secure, high-performance environment for a wide range
of use cases.

### Business

The Business class is Scalingo’s flagship. It guarantees high availability and
reliability, which are essential for critical production applications. Thanks
to hot replication of your data on a standby instance, we ensure service
continuity along with a 99.96% SLA. For complete protection, backup retention
is extended to 1 year.
