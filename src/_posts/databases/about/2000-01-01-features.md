All our databases share a common set of powerful features designed to
ensure the security of your data, and spare you the difficulties of maintaining
all the necessary tools and services. We keep your data safe and available.

Please check the dedicated *Features* page of each database for a list of
features specific to each engine.

- [Upgrade](#upgrade)
- [Plan Change](#plan-change)
- [Logs](#logs)
- [Metrics](#metrics)
- [TLS](#tls)
- [Encryption at Rest](#encryption-at-rest)
- [Backups](#backups)
- [Maintenance Windows](#maintenance-windows)

All features are manageable via our [API][api] and [CLI][cli], and most are 
also manageable from the [Database Dashboard][database-dashboard], a clear and 
accessible UI designed for developers.

### Upgrade

All our databases can be upgraded to more recent versions once they are made
available on the platform. The delay between an official release and the
availability on the platform depends on the database engine: some upgrades are 
quite straightforward, while some others require more work and testing. 
Upgrading is usually a matter of clicking a button.

Please check the dedicated *Upgrading* page of each database engine for
further details about the upgrade process, and its potential consequences (best
practices before proceeding, expected downtime, etc.)

### Plan Change

Scalingo allows you to change your plan whenever you want, and in any way you 
see fit. \
Please keep in mind that this remains your responsibility, and that it may have
bad consequences on your database, especially when switching for a less
powerful plan. We strongly advise to follow our best practices guidelines
before changing a database plan.

Please check the dedicated *Changing Plan* page of each database engine for
further details about the plan change process, and its potential consequences
(best practices before proceeding, expected downtime, etc.)

### Logs

All our databases services come with logs, allowing you to monitor your instance
health. They are fully available, either from the [database
dashboard][database-dashboard], from the [command line][cli] or from our
[api][api-db-logs]. [Log drains][log-drains] are available for databases too.

All the logs we have are made available for you, we don't hide anything.

Please check the dedicated *Monitoring and Auditing* page of each database
engine for further information related to logs and metrics.

### Metrics

All our databases come with metrics allowing to evaluate the
performances of your database. These metrics include CPU usage, memory usage,
disk usage and disk i/o for all database nodes. For business plans, metrics of
the cluster gateways are also available.

Metrics are available from the [database dashboard][database-dashboard], from
the [command line][cli] and from our [api][api-db-metrics].

Please check the dedicated *Monitoring and Auditing* page of each database
engine for further information related to logs and metrics.

### TLS

Transport Layer Security (TLS) is a cryptographic protocol designed to provide
privacy (confidentiality), integrity, and authenticity to communications over a
network. To do so, the protocol encrypts data transiting between the database
and the client.

TLS is always available on Scalingo, yet never strictly enforced. Depending on
the database, it may not be enabled by default.

We usually advise to enable it.

Moreover, we also encrypt all communications between the members of cluster:
- From the gateways to the primary instance.
- From the primary instance to the other members of the cluster (when in this
  case).
- Between the cluster orchestrator and its database for PostgreSQL databases.

### Encryption at Rest

All databases provisioned on Scalingo have encryption at rest enabled.
Encryption at rest leverages a feature of the Linux Kernel, named `dm-crypt`,
allowing to encrypt data at the disk level. The algorithm used is
`aes-xts-plain64` with a key size of 256 bits and hashed using `SHA-256`. This
method is considered secure and standard in the industry. To reduce the attack
surface, each instance of each database has its own cryptographic key to
protect its data, so getting access to one key wouldn't allow an attacker to
get plain data from another database. The keys are stored in a database which
is itself encrypted and protected by authentication.

### Backups

All plans include automated, managed backups designed to support reliable data
recovery. Depending on the architecture model, the typical recovery point
objective (RPO) ranges from about 5 minutes with continuous backups to up to
1 day with logical backups. Backup technology and retention policy depend on
the database engine and architecture model. For details, refer to the
documentation for the engine you plan to use.

Backups are encrypted and duplicated in the three availability zones of the
region where the database is hosted. We also manage the backup lifecycles to
comply with legal obligations.

Our [Backup Policies][backup-policies] page provides an exhaustive view of our
backup policies (retentions, etc.). We encourage you to have a look at it.

Please also check the dedicated *Backing Up* page of each database engine for
further details about the backup process we setup for you.

### Maintenance Windows

Windows.
