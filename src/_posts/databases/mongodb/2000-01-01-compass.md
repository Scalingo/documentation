MongoDB® Compass is the official GUI to manage MongoDB® database.
It supports CRUD operations and offers nice visualization of your data.
It is freely available on the
[MongoDB® website](https://www.mongodb.com/products/compass).

Databases hosted on Scalingo are not by default directly available on Internet.
There are a couple of ways to get access to a Scalingo for MongoDB® database
with MongoDB® Compass:
* Connection via an Encrypted Tunnel
* Connection via the DB Tunnel of our CLI
* Connection with TLS

More information in the [dedicated page]({% post_url
platform/databases/2000-01-01-access %}).

## Configuration of Compass

The connection URI can be found in the `MONGO_URL` environment variable of your
application from the [web dashboard](https://dashboard.scalingo.com) or from the CLI:

```bash
$ scalingo --app my-app env-get MONGO_URL
mongodb://my-app-7093:YANs3y07m5_KJC2MSDGebh8tx1lliFWh2Yb239zVqGQvbElWDjIN7QWspVH92Ul8@c393a9e3-42fe-4e33-9e6c-8ee815e9af88.my-app-7093.mongo.a.osc-fr1.scalingo-dbs.com:31312/my-app-7093?replicaSet=my-app-7093-rs0&ssl=true
```

In this case:
* Hostname: c393a9e3-42fe-4e33-9e6c-8ee815e9af88.my-app-7093.mongo.a.osc-fr1.scalingo-dbs.com
* Port: 31312
* User: my-app-7093
* Password: YANs3y07m5_KJC2MSDGebh8tx1lliFWh2Yb239zVqGQvbElWDjIN7QWspVH92Ul8
* Database: my-app-7093

### Connection via an Encrypted Tunnel

Open MongoDB® Compass, then click on "New Connection".
After that click on "Advanced Connection Options" and fill the fields
accordingly:

* General
    * Connection String Scheme: mongodb
    * Host: c393a9e3-42fe-4e33-9e6c-8ee815e9af88.my-app-7093.mongo.a.osc-fr1.
    scalingo-dbs.com:31312 (Hostname + Port)
* Authentication
    * Authentication Method: Username / Password
    * Authentication database: database name or authSource from `SCALINGO_MONGO_URL`
    * Authentication Mechanism: Default
* TLS/SSL
    * SSL/TLS Connection: On
    * Certificate Authority (.pem): Depends on the region where your database
    is hosted. You can find URLs of our CA certificates at the end of
    [this page](#ca-certificates) and use it here.
* Proxy/SSH Tunnel
    * SSH Tunnel/Proxy Method: SSH with Identity File
    * SSH Hostname/SSH Port/SSH Username: Depends on the region where your
    database is hosted. You can find all information at the end of
    [this page](#ssh-endpoints) and use it here.
    * SSH Identity File: Your private SSH key linked to the public SSH key you
    uploaded on the [SSH Keys page](https://dashboard.scalingo.com/account/keys)
    of the Scalingo dashboard.
* Advanced
    * Read Preference: Default

### Connection via the DB Tunnel of our CLI

You can also use another method, that consist to create an Encrypted Tunnel
with our CLI. Then in MongoDB® Compass to connect into the database with a
local address which correspond to the DB Tunnel.

{% note %}
    In order to setup a db-tunnel, you will need to [setup you SSH key]({% post_url platform/getting-started/2000-01-01-first-steps %}#ssh-key-setup)
{% endnote %}

Let's open a DB Tunnel with the Scalingo CLI:
```bash
$ scalingo --app my-app db-tunnel SCALINGO_MONGO_URL
Building tunnel to c393a9e3-42fe-4e33-9e6c-8ee815e9af88.my-app-7093.mongo.a.osc-fr1.scalingo-dbs.com:31312
You can access your database on:
127.0.0.1:10000
```

Open MongoDB® Compass, then click on "New Connection".
After that click on "Advanced Connection Options" and fill the fields
accordingly:

* General
    * Connection String Scheme: mongodb
    * Host: 127.0.0.1:10000 (Hostname + Port)
    * Direct Connection: Yes
* Authentication
    * Authentication Method: Username / Password
    * Authentication database: database name or authSource from `SCALINGO_MONGO_URL`
    * Authentication Mechanism: Default
* TLS/SSL
    * SSL/TLS Connection: Default
* Proxy/SSH Tunnel
    * SSH Tunnel/Proxy Method: None
* Advanced
    * Read Preference: Default

{% include mongo_db_tunnel.md %}

### Connection with TLS

As a replacement to using an encrypted tunnel to connect to your database,
you can make it available on the internet from your database dashboard.
You must activate the
[Database Network Exposure]({% post_url databases/about/2000-01-01-network-exposure %}#making-your-database-reachable-from-the-internet).

Open MongoDB® Compass, then click on "New Connection".
After that click on "Advanced Connection Options" and fill the fields
accordingly:

* General
    * Connection String Scheme: mongodb
    * Host: c393a9e3-42fe-4e33-9e6c-8ee815e9af88.my-app-7093.mongo.a.osc-fr1.scalingo-dbs.com:31312 (Hostname + Port)
* Authentication
    * Authentication Method: Username / Password
    * Authentication database: database name or authSource from `SCALINGO_MONGO_URL`
    * Authentication Mechanism: Default
* TLS/SSL
    * SSL/TLS Connection: On
    * Certificate Authority (.pem): Depends on the region where your database
    is hosted. You can find URLs of our CA certificates at the end of
    [this page](#ca-certificates) and use it here.
* Proxy/SSH Tunnel
    * SSH Tunnel/Proxy Method: None
* Advanced
    * Read Preference: Default

### Common issues

#### topology type: unknown is not writable

If your plan has a single node replica, you might see the error
`topology type: unknown is not writable` in MongoDB® Compass.
In such case, you should leave the field "Replica Set Name" from "Advanced"
section empty.
