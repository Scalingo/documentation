## Requirements

Databases hosted on Scalingo are not by default directly available on the
Internet. There are a couple of ways to get access to a Scalingo hosted
database: building an SSH tunnel and making the database available on the
internet. More information in the [dedicated page]({% post_url
platform/databases/2000-01-01-access %}).

## Configuration of Robo 3T

### Connection via an Encrypted Tunnel

Robo 3T (formerly Robomongo) lets you configure this tunnel. We will guide
through the steps to configure the connection to a Scalingo for MongoDB® instance
through an encrypted tunnel.

The connection data can be found from the `MONGO_URL` environment variable of your
application.

```
$ scalingo env | grep MONGO_URL
MONGO_URL=mongodb://sample-node-meanjs-7093:EsEjseivpacatVoogfijbiapgadTyg@c393a9e3-42fe-4e33-9e6c-8ee815e9af88.sample-node-meanjs-7093.mongodb.a.osc-fr1.scalingo-dbs.com:31312/sample-node-meanjs-7093
```

In this case:

* Hostname: c393a9e3-42fe-4e33-9e6c-8ee815e9af88.sample-node-meanjs-7093.mongodb.a.osc-fr1.scalingo-dbs.com
* Port: 31312
* User: sample-node-meanjs-7093
* Password: EsEjseivpacatVoogfijbiapgadTyg
* Database: sample-node-meanjs-7093

Fill the fields accordingly:

{% assign img_url = "https://cdn.scalingo.com/documentation/robomongo/connection_ssh_tunnel.png" %}
{% include mdl_img.html %}

{% assign img_url = "https://cdn.scalingo.com/documentation/robomongo/authentication.png" %}
{% include mdl_img.html %}

{% assign img_url = "https://cdn.scalingo.com/documentation/robomongo/ssh_tunnel.png" %}
{% include mdl_img.html %}

{% assign img_url = "https://cdn.scalingo.com/documentation/robomongo/advanced.png" %}
{% include mdl_img.html %}

The "Private key" to provide in the "SSH" tab is your private SSH key you
uploaded on your Scalingo profile.

The "SSH Hostname" and "SSH Port" depends on the region your database is
deployed on:

{% include ssh_endpoints.md %}

Validate the configuration and click on connect, that's it.

### Connection with TLS

As a replacement to using an encrypted tunnel to connect to your database, you
can make it available on the internet from your database dashboard. You must
first [force TLS]({% post_url databases/mongodb/2000-01-01-start
%}#force-tls-connections) connections.

This is done in Robo 3T under the "SSL" tab:

{% include mdl_img.html %}

{% include db_ca_endpoints.md %}
