OpenSearch® is a very robust solution when it comes to manage logs, thanks to
its Lucene-based search engine and abilities to scale. Its native features
makes log centralization, observability, monitoring and troubleshooting a
breeze.

## Understanding the Logs Stack

Even if it's the main component, the OpenSearch® database itself is not enough
to provide an efficient stack to manage logs. It's often deployed with
additional components to make it a full-featured **logs stack**:

- **Logs Collector**\
  Retrieves logs from sources (applications, databases) and forwards them to
  the ingestion solution.\
  *Examples*: [Scalingo's log drains][log-drains], Filebeat
- **Logs Ingestion**\
  Parses, enriches, transforms, filters, normalizes and aggregates log
  entries.\
  *Examples*: Logstash, OpenSearch® Ingest Pipelines, OpenSearch® Data Prepper,
  Fluentd
- **Storage**\
  Indexes and stores log entries.\
  *Examples*: OpenSearch® database
- **Visualization**\
  Allows to search, query and visualize the content of indexes.\
  *Examples*: Kibana, OpenSearch® Dashboards
- **Data Lifecyle Management**\
  Manages log entries, removes the oldest useless ones.\
  *Examples*: Curator, OpenSearch® Index State Management

The following schema shows how these components are linked:

## Planning your Deployment

{% note %}
While choosing a tool for each component of the stack is up to you, we advise
to take extra care with the version of the components. Some require specific
versions to work with our current OpenSearch® database version.

If you don't know where to start, we suggest to start with the following set of
tools, which are known to work well on Scalingo and for which we have
documentation:

| Role                      | Tool                                           |
| ------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------- |
| Logs Collector            | [Scalingo's Log Drain][log-drains]             |
| Logs Ingestion            | [Logstash][opensearch-logstash]                |
| Storage                   | [Scalingo for OpenSearch® addon][opensearch]   |
| Visualization             | [OpenSearch Dashboards][opensearch-dashboards] |
| Data Lifecycle Management | [Scalingo for OpenSearch® addon][opensearch]   |
