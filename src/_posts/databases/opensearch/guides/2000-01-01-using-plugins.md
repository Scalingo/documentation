OpenSearch速 comes with a set of plugins that enhance the core platform by
adding extra features and functionality.

Scalingo supports most plugins bundled with the standard OpenSearch速
distribution, and also includes a curated set of additional, commonly used
plugins. All these plugins are installed, enabled, and ready to use out of the
box.

{% note %}
- Access provided by Scalingo does not allow you to install, remove, or modify
  plugins. If you require a plugin that is not currently available, feel free
  to contact our support team.
- The `opensearch-security` plugin is **not** included. Some features related
  to authentication, authorization, and fine-grained access control are not
  available. Please refer to the official OpenSearch速 documentation for
  details.
