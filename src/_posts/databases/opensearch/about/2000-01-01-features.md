### High Availability

**Business plans** include a fully-managed cluster made of:

- Three (3) OpenSearch® nodes that are all cluster-manager-eligible, data,
  ingest and coordinating nodes.

  | Node Type                | Description                                                                                                                         |
  | ------------------------ | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
  | cluster-manager          | Manages the overall operation of a cluster and keeps track of the cluster state.                                                    |
  | cluster-manager-eligible | Elects one node among them as the cluster manager node through a voting process.                                                    |
  | data                     | Stores and searches data. Performs all data-related operations on local shards. These are the worker nodes of the cluster.          |
  | ingest                   | Pre-processes data before storing it in the cluster. Runs an ingest pipeline that transforms the data before adding it to an index. |
  | coordinating             | Delegates client requests to the shards on the data nodes, collects and aggregates the results into one final result, and sends this result back to the client. |

- Two (2) HAProxy® (one active and one standby) as entrypoint to your cluster
  private network.

The communication between the OpenSearch® nodes is encrypted.

Choosing such a plan drastically lowers the risk of unavailability, be it
during a maintenance operation (database upgrade, for example) or because of a
platform issue.
