In addition to the [features common to every database
addon][databases-features], Scalingo includes several features that are
specific to our Scalingo for OpenSearch® offers.

The following table lists these features, with distinguishing values for each
class of service. A short description of each feature is also available after
the table.


| Feature                                            | Starter        | Business       |
| -------------------------------------------------- | :------------: | :------------: |
| RAM                                                | 1 GB - 32 GB   | 1 GB - 32 GB   |
| Included Storage                                   | 20 GB - 640 GB | 20 GB - 640 GB |
| [Plugins](#plugins)                                | Yes            | Yes            |
| Nodes ([High Availability](#high-availability))    | 1              | 3              |
| Gateways ([High Availability](#high-availability)) | 1              | 2              |

### Plugins

Scalingo for OpenSearch® addons includes several plugins that add features and
capabilities to the core platform. We also add a few additional plugins. They
are all available with each addon and don't require any extra work to be
enabled.

Please refer to the *Using Plugins* page for an exhaustive [list of available
plugins][available-plugins].

### High Availability

**Starter plans** are running on a single node, without any redundancy or high
availability mechanism. Consequently, we don't consider them to be *highly
available*. This translates into a lower [Service Level
Agreement][databases-sla].

**Business plans**, on their side, include a fully-managed cluster made of:

- Three (3) OpenSearch® nodes that are all cluster-manager-eligible, data,
  ingest and coordinating nodes.

  | Node Type                | Description                                                                                                                         |
  | ------------------------ | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
  | cluster-manager          | Manages the overall operation of a cluster and keeps track of the cluster state.                                                    |
  | cluster-manager-eligible | Elects one node among them as the cluster manager node through a voting process.                                                    |
  | data                     | Stores and searches data. Performs all data-related operations on local shards. These are the worker nodes of the cluster.          |
  | ingest                   | Pre-processes data before storing it in the cluster. Runs an ingest pipeline that transforms the data before adding it to an index. |
  | coordinating             | Delegates client requests to the shards on the data nodes, collects and aggregates the results into one final result, and sends this result back to the client. |

- Two (2) HAProxy® (one active and one standby) as entrypoint to your cluster
  private network.

- Encrypted communications between all nodes of the cluster.

The following schema describes the cluster we setup and maintain for each
Business plan:

{% include mdl_img.html %}

Choosing such a plan drastically lowers the risk of unavailability, be it
during a maintenance operation (database upgrade, for example) or because of a
platform issue.
