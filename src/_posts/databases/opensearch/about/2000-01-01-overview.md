## OpenSearch®

OpenSearch® is a free and open-source search and analytics engine developed by
Amazon and designed as a community-driven fork of Elasticsearch® 7.10, after
Elastic® changed its licensing model. It allows users to ingest, search,
visualize, and analyze large volumes of data quickly and in real time.
OpenSearch® supports a variety of use cases such as log analytics,
observability, and enterprise search, thanks to its powerful full-text search
capabilities, scalability and RESTful API. Its modular design makes it a very
good choice for both small applications, and large-scale, distributed systems.
