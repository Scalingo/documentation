Each Scalingo for PostgreSQL® addon comes with several tools allowing for basic
monitoring and auditing of your database. These tools give access to the
[database logs](#consulting-database-logs), to some [metrics](#consulting-database-metrics)
and to [running queries figures](#viewing-running-queries). [Query Statistics](#consulting-query-statistics)
are also available if the `pg_stats` extension is added to the database.

All these tools are available from the [database dashboard]({% post_url databases/postgresql/2000-01-01-getting-started %}#accessing-the-database-dashboard).
