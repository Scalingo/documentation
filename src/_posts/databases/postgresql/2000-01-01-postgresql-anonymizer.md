**PostgreSQL Anonymizer** is an open-source extension for PostgreSQL® that facilitates the masking or replacement of personally identifiable information (PII) and commercially sensitive data directly within a database.

This extension is particularly useful for organizations handling sensitive data and is designed with **anonymization by design** principles to ensure compliance with privacy regulations such as GDPR, HIPAA, and CCPA.

This extension adds several features and functions. You can find more information on the [official documentation](https://postgresql-anonymizer.readthedocs.io/en/stable/).

## Enabling PostgreSQL® Anonymizer

1. [Create a new user with read only abilities]({% post_url databases/postgresql/2000-01-01-managing-users %})
2. Contact our support team and provide the name of the user you just created to request activation of the extension
3. Our team activates the extension and sets up masking for the given user
4. Once done, you can define and manage masking rules for your user autonomously as described below.

## Example: Dynamic Masking for Read-Only Users

Suppose you have a table named users containing the columns `first_name`, `last_name`, `email`, and `phone` and you want to hide sensitive data dynamically for specific users.

These users must be `read-only` and should have been masked as described above. You can then declare `SECURITY LABEL` with your regular user:

* Regular roles will still access the original data
* Masked user will see altered data according to the rules you have set

Connect as the regular user to the database:

```sql
SELECT * FROM people;

Result:
  id | firstname | lastname |   phone    |         email
 ----+-----------+----------+------------+-------------------------
   1 | Sarah     | Conor    | 0606060606 |  sarah.conor@example.com
   2 | John      | Doe      | 0707070707 |  john.doe@example.com

-- Declare the masking rules
SECURITY LABEL FOR anon ON COLUMN people.lastname
IS 'MASKED WITH FUNCTION anon.dummy_last_name();';

SECURITY LABEL FOR anon ON COLUMN people.phone
IS 'MASKED WITH FUNCTION anon.partial(phone, 2, $$******$$, 2)';
```

Connect as the "read-only" user to the database and view data:

```sql
SELECT * FROM people;

 Result:
  id | firstname | lastname  |    phone     |           email
 ----+-----------+-----------+--------------+----------------------------
   1 |  Sarah    | Preston   | 06********06 | rayamanda@example.net
   2 |  John     | Cristian  | 07********07 | mariahpatrick@example.org
```

## Example: Anonymizing Entire Rows with a Query

Suppose you have a table named users containing the columns `first_name`, `last_name`, `email`, and `phone`. If you want to retrieve as many rows as your query can fetch with anonymized data, you can use the following query:

```sql
SELECT anon.fake_last_name() AS anonymized_last_name,
       anon.fake_first_name() AS anonymized_first_name,
       anon.random_phone('+33') AS anonymized_phone,
       anon.fake_email() AS anonymized_email
FROM users;

anonymized_last_name | anonymized_first_name | anonymized_phone |      anonymized_email
