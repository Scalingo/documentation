**PostgreSQL Anonymizer** is an open-source extension for PostgreSQLÂ® that facilitates the masking or replacement of personally identifiable information (PII) and commercially sensitive data directly within a database.

This extension is particularly useful for organizations handling sensitive data and is designed with **anonymization by design** principles to ensure compliance with privacy regulations such as GDPR, HIPAA, and CCPA.

The extension supports the following features:

- Static anonymization: Irreversibly anonymize data for development or testing environments.
- Dynamic masking: Apply real-time masking to hide sensitive information for specific users or roles.
- Customizable anonymization rules: Use pre-defined or user-defined strategies for anonymization.
- Multiple anonymization techniques: Including randomization, hashing, and data redaction.
- Role-based access control: Restrict visibility of sensitive data based on user roles.
- Compatibility with standard PostgreSQL queries and tools.

## Usage Examples for PostgreSQL Anonymizer
### Anonymizing Entire Rows with a Query

Suppose you have a table named users containing the columns `first_name`, `last_name`, `email`, and `phone`. If you want to retrieve as many rows as your query can fetch with anonymized data, you can use the following query:

```sql
SELECT anon.fake_last_name() AS anonymized_last_name, 
       anon.fake_first_name() AS anonymized_first_name, 
       anon.random_phone('+33') AS anonymized_phone, 
       anon.fake_email() AS anonymized_email
FROM users;

anonymized_last_name | anonymized_first_name | anonymized_phone |      anonymized_email

```

### Dynamic Masking for Read-Only Users

Suppose you have a table named users containing the columns `first_name`, `last_name`, `email`, and `phone`. If you want to hide sensitive data dynamically for specific users, such as a "read-only" user as "MASKED", you can declare `SECURITY LABEL` for its. Other roles will still access the original data.

Example: Hiding Data for a "Masked" User

```sql
-- View data as a regular user
SELECT * FROM people;

Result:
  id | firstname | lastname |   phone    |         email
 ----+-----------+----------+------------+-------------------------
   1 | Sarah     | Conor    | 0606060606 |  sarah.conor@example.com
   2 | John      | Doe      | 0707070707 |  john.doe@example.com

-- Declare the masking rules
SECURITY LABEL FOR anon ON COLUMN people.lastname
IS 'MASKED WITH FUNCTION anon.dummy_last_name();';

SECURITY LABEL FOR anon ON COLUMN people.phone
IS 'MASKED WITH FUNCTION anon.partial(phone, 2, $$******$$, 2)';

-- Connect as the masked user and view data
\c - my_read_only_user
SELECT * FROM people;

 Result:
  id | firstname | lastname  |    phone     |           email

   2 |  Shaffer  | Cristian  | +33225352636 | mariahpatrick@example.org
```

## Enabling PostgreSQL Anonymizer

To enable PostgreSQL Anonymizer:

1. Create a "read_only" user through your database dashboard.
2. Contact our support team and provide the name of your "read_only" user to request activation of the extension.
3. Our team will activate the extension and set up masking for your "read_only" user.
4. Once completed, you can use the extension to define and manage masking rules for your "read_only" user independently.
