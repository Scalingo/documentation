As Scalingo for PostgreSQL速 is a fully managed service, we enforce certain
operational limits and usage policies to maintain reliability and security for
all users.


## Affecting User Management

- Updating the [protected user][postgresql-protected-user]'s password is not
  supported. Please get in touch with our support team to refresh this
  password.


## Affecting Backups and Restorations

- When restoring from a Point-in-Time Recovery backup, PostgreSQL速 switches to
  a new [timeline][postgresql-timelines]. Consequently, you **must not**
  restore from another PiTR backup created before the restoration date and
  time.


## Affecting Features

- When using a Business plan, the replica instance of the cluster is not
  accessible. This instance is only present to ensure high-availability. It's
  not meant to plug analysis tools, even in read-only mode.

- Only one named database is provisioned per addon. [PostgreSQL速's
  schemas][postgresql-schemas] can be leveraged to create different logical
  groups of database objects (i.e. tables, views, functions, etc.)


## Affecting Extensions

- The `pg_repack` extension requires superuser permissions and thus, can
  only be run by our operators. Please get in touch with our support team to
  plan the operation.


## Timeouts

Scalingo for PostgreSQL速 addons have, depending on the plan, one or two HAProxy
instances as entry point. These HAProxy instances have a few timeouts
configured which may impact your application, especially when reusing
connections.

| Context                                    | Timeout    |
| ------------------------------------------ | ---------- |
| Client is inactive                         | 1 day      |
| Server is inactive                         | 30 minutes |
| Half-closed connections on the client side | 5 minutes  |
