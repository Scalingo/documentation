Scalingo for PostgreSQL® is available across several service classes.
Each service class corresponds to a defined availability level and a specific 
set of features.

## High Availability Setups

High availability, clustering, and SLAs are defined by the 
[service class][databases-sc] and do not depend on the 
[architecture model][architecture-models].

| Service class | High Availability | Cluster composition             | SLA    |
|---------------|-------------------|---------------------------------|--------|
| Starter       | No                | Single node                     | 98%    |
| Business      | Yes               | 1 primary node, 1 standby node  | 99.96% |
| Enterprise    | Yes               | 1 primary node, 2 standby nodes | 99.99% |

The architecture model mainly affects how node–gateway pairs are placed. 
With Dedicated Resources, they are spread across up to three availability 
zones (AZs).

| Architecture model  | Placement                                                                      |
|---------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Shared Resources    | Nodes and gateways are placed in the same availability zone                    |
| Dedicated Resources | Nodes and gateways are distributed across up to 3 different availability zones |

## Single-node plans

**Starter plans** are running on a single node, **withou**t** any
redundancy or high availability mechanism. Consequently, we don't consider them
to be *highly available*. This translates into a lower [Service Level
Agreement][databases-sc].

## Highly Available plans

### Business Plans

Business plans include a fully-managed cluster made of:

- Two (2) PostgreSQL® instances: one primary and one replica, ensuring near
  real-time replication between the two.
- Two (2) HAProxy® (one active and one standby) as entrypoint to your cluster.

The following schema describes the cluster we setup and maintain for each
Business plan:

{% include mdl_img.html %}

### Enterprise Plans

They include a fully-managed cluster made of:

- Three (3) PostgreSQL® instances: one primary and two replicas, ensuring near
  real-time replication between the three.
- Three (3) HAProxy® (one active and two standby) as entrypoint to the cluster.

## Primary and standby nodes

Business and Enterprise plans include one primary node and one or more standby nodes. Standby nodes improve service continuity by:

- Provides another physical copy of the data in case of hardware, software, or network failures
- Typically reduces the data loss window in disaster scenarios
- Provides a quicker database time to restore with a controlled failover in case of failures as the standby is already installed, running, and synchronised with the data
- can be used by our backup tools to reduce the load on the primary server[^1]

- Maintaining an up-to-date secondary copy of the data.
- Reducing the potential data loss window in disaster scenarios.
- Enabling faster recovery through controlled failover, since standby nodes are already running and synchronised.
- Offloading backups, when supported, to reduce load on the primary node.[^1]

[^1]: Offloading applies only to Scalingo-managed backups. If you run your own backups by connecting directly to the database, they will query the primary node.
