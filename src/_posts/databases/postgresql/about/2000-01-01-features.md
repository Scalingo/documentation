Scalingo for PostgreSQL® includes the [common features][databases-features] of 
our managed database service, plus PostgreSQL®-specific capabilities such as 
extensions:

- Scale from a single-node instance to a multi-node, [highly available](#high-availability) cluster
- Choose the right size for your workload, from 512 MB to 512 GB of RAM
- Scale storage from 10 GB to 10 TB
- Scale [concurents connections](#concurrent-connection-limits) from 30 to 12800
- Extend PostgreSQL® by enabling [extensions](#extensions)
- Deploy on Shared or Dedicated Resources (available on request)


## Extensions

Scalingo for PostgreSQL® addons includes several extensions that are available,
but not enabled by default. Most of them can be enabled within seconds.

Please refer to the *Managing Extensions* page for an exhaustive [list of
available extensions][available-extensions].

We also have dedicated pages for [PostGIS][postgis],
[TimescaleDB®][timescaledb], [pgvector][pgvector] and [PosgreSQL®
Anonymizer][postgresql-anonymizer].


## High Availability

Scalingo for PostgreSQL® is available across several service classes.
Each service class corresponds to a defined availability level and a specific 
set of features.

| Service class | High Availability | Cluster composition             | SLA    |
|---------------|-------------------|---------------------------------|--------|
| Starter       | No                | Single node                     | 98%    |
| Business      | Yes               | 1 primary node, 1 standby node  | 99.96% |
| Enterprise    | Yes               | 1 primary node, 2 standby nodes | 99.99% |

Business and Enterprise plans are designed for higher service continuity, including during maintenance and platform incidents. Choose the [Service Classe and Service Level Agreement][databases-sc] that fits your use case.

For more details, see our [High Availability of Scalingo for PostgreSQL®][postgresql-ha] page.


## Concurrent connection limits

Each service class enforces a maximum number of concurrent connections to ensure 
stable performance for your database. If you need a higher connection limit, the 
only supported way is to select a service class that matches your workload 
requirements.

| Architecture model  | Connection limit  |
|---------------------|-------------------|
| Shared Resources    | 60 per GB of RAM  |
| Dedicated Resources | 100 per GB of RAM |

For example, a PostgreSQL® Starter database on Shared Resources with 1 GB RAM 
allows up to 60 concurrent connections, while a PostgreSQL® Business database on 
Dedicated Resources with 16 GB RAM allows up to 1600 concurrent connections.

{% note %}
To stay within connection limits, we recommend using connection pooling to reuse 
connections and reduce the overhead of opening a new connection for each query.
