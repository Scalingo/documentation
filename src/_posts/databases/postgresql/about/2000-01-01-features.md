In addition to the [features common to every database
addon][databases-features], Scalingo includes several features that are
specific to our Scalingo for PostgreSQL® offers.

class of service. A short description of each feature is also available after

### High Availability

Scalingo for PostgreSQL® is available across several service classes.
Each service class corresponds to a defined availability level and a specific 
set of features.

|---------------|-------------------|---------------------------------|--------|
| Starter       | No                | Single node                     | 98%    |
| Business      | Yes               | 1 primary node, 1 standby node  | 99.96% |
| Enterprise    | Yes               | 1 primary node, 2 standby nodes | 99.99% |

Business and Enterprise plans are designed for higher service continuity, including during maintenance and platform incidents. Choose the [Service Classe and Service Level Agreement][databases-sc] that fit your use case.
