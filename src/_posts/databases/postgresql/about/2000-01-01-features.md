In addition to the [features common to every database
addon][databases-features], Scalingo includes several features that are
specific to our Scalingo for PostgreSQL® offers.

The following table lists these features, with distinguishing values for each
class of service. A short description of each feature is also available after
the table.

| Feature                                            | Starter         | Business        |
| -------------------------------------------------- | :-------------: | :-------------: |
| RAM                                                | 512 MB - 64 GB  | 512 MB - 128 GB |
| Included Storage                                   | 10 GB - 1280 GB | 10 GB - 2560 GB |
| Maximum number of connections                      | 30 - 3840       | 30 - 7680       |
| [Extensions](#extensions)                          | Yes             | Yes             |
| Nodes ([High Availability](#high-availability))    | 1               | 2               |
| Gateways ([High Availability](#high-availability)) | 1               | 2               |

### Extensions

Scalingo for PostgreSQL® addons includes several extensions that are available,
but not enabled by default. Most of them can be enabled within seconds.

Please refer to the *Managing Extensions* page for an exhaustive [list of
available extensions][available-extensions].

We also have dedicated pages for [PostGIS][postgis],
[TimescaleDB®][timescaledb], [pgvector][pgvector] and [PosgreSQL®
Anonymizer][postgresql-anonymizer].

### High Availability

**Starter plans** are running on a single node, without any
redundancy or high availability mechanism. Consequently, we don't consider them
to be *highly available*. This translates into a lower [Service Level
Agreement][databases-sla].

**Business plans**, on their side, include a fully-managed cluster made of:

- Two (2) PostgreSQL® instances: one primary and one replica, ensuring near
  real-time replication between the two.

- Two (2) HAProxy® (one active and one standby) as entrypoint to your cluster
  private network.

- Encrypted communications between all instances of the cluster.

The following schema describes the cluster we setup and maintain for each
Business plan:

{% assign img_url = "https://cdn.scalingo.com/documentation/documentation_postgresql_cluster.png" %}
{% include mdl_img.html %}

Choosing such a plan drastically lowers the risk of unavailability, be it
during a maintenance operation (database upgrade, for example) or because of a
platform issue.
