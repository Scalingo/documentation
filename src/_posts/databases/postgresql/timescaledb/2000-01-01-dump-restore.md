{% warning %}
  The backup restoration process may put the database in an undesirable state.
{% endwarning %}

## Dump

You can use the command `pg_dump` as explained
[on our documentation]({% post_url databases/postgresql/2000-01-01-dump-restore %}).
But you cannot restore it on a PostgreSQL® instance using TimescaleDB hosted on Scalingo.

The only dump available to make restorable backups on Scalingo hosted TimescaleDB
are the [on demand backups]({% post_url databases/postgresql/2000-01-01-start %}#on-demand-backups).
The reason is that the restoration process must be done by the Scalingo support using
these specific backups, see below.

Note that [Point-in-Time Recovery]({% post_url databases/postgresql/2000-01-01-start %}#point-in-time-recovery)
backups are still working normally.

## Restore

The backup restoration on TimescaleDB requires a specific process to be done on
the PostgreSQL® database as it is explained on
[TimescaleDB official documentation](https://docs.timescale.com/timescaledb/latest/how-to-guides/backup-and-restore/pg-dump-and-restore/#restoring-an-entire-database-from-backup).
A temporary database should be used for the backup restore and the following
command should be executed using admin rights:
```sql
SELECT timescaledb_pre_restore();
\! pg_restore -Fc -d exampledb exampledb.psql
SELECT timescaledb_post_restore();
```
On Scalingo, default user does not have admin rights on database, this means that this
process must be done by an operator of the support.

## Warnings

Several points are important to take into account.

Make sure you keep track of which versions of PostgreSQL® and TimescaleDB you are
running during backup process. For more information, see "Troubleshooting version mismatches" of
[official documentation](https://docs.timescale.com/timescaledb/latest/how-to-guides/backup-and-restore/pg-dump-and-restore/#tshoot-version-mismatch).

You cannot backup an individual hypertable, `pg_dump` creates dumps that do not
contain the information needed to properly restore the hypertable from a backup.

You can find more details on the
[TimescaleDB documentation: "logical backups with pg_dump and pg_restore"](https://docs.timescale.com/timescaledb/latest/how-to-guides/backup-and-restore/pg-dump-and-restore/).
