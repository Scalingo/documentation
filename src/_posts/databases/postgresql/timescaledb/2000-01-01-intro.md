TimescaleDB is a ® extension for the support of time series data.
This extension adds several features and functions. You can find more information
on the [official documentation](https://docs.timescale.com/api/latest). TimescaleDB is available in Scalingo for PostgreSQL® databases starting with the version 13.6.0-1.

To enable TimescaleDB, provision a [new Scalingo for PostgreSQL® database]({% post_url databases/postgresql/2000-01-01-start %}#adding-postgresql-to-your-app) and execute the following SQL command:

```sql
CREATE EXTENSION timescaledb;
```

That's it, TimescaleDB Open-source is enabled on your database!

There are multiple licenses of TimescaleDB, __Community edition__ and
__Open-source edition__. The latter is the only one available on Scalingo, hence
TimescaleDB's functions labeled "community" on their documentation
are not available on the platform.

Working with time series database usually involves the need to compress data
in runtime and remove the oldest data. We show you how to configure it
so that it is done automatically:
* [Downsampling]({% post_url databases/postgresql/timescaledb/2000-01-01-downsampling %})
* [Data retention]({% post_url databases/postgresql/timescaledb/2000-01-01-data-retention %})
* [Dump and restore]({% post_url databases/postgresql/timescaledb/2000-01-01-dump-restore %})
