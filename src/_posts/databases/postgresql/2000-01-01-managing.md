## Scaling (Changing Plan)

You can change your database plan whenever you want. This operation happens
instantly, no manual input is required. When you change the plan, the instances
of your database are stopped and then restarted with the characteristics of the
chosen plan. According to the type of plan you are originally using, the impact
on your application differs:
- **Starter Plans**: Since these plans are not highly available, expect some
  unavailability during which the scale operations are conducted. The duration
  highly depends on the database size (from seconds to several hours).
- **Business Plans**: Thanks to high availability, only a failover occurs
  during the operation. Current connections are stopped and the application has
  to reconnect. It can be transparent or lead to a ~2-5 seconds interruption,
  depending on the driver used by your application and its configuration.

In both cases, once the operation is finished, the application is restarted to
ensure it creates new healthy connections to the database.

{% warning %}
While upscaling (changing for a more powerful plan) is rather safe, you should
take extra care when downscaling: please make sure the new plan can handle all
your data and fits your application workload.
{% endwarning %}

### Using the Dashboard

1. From your web browser, open your [dashboard](https://dashboard.scalingo.com/apps)
2. Click on the application for which you want to scale the Scalingo for
   PostgreSQL® addon
3. Click on the **Resources** tab
4. Locate the **Addons** block
5. Click the **"&#8230;"** button
6. From the dropdown menu, select **Change plan**
7. Select the new plan
8. Click the **Finish** button
9. Validate by clicking the **Confirm plan change** button

### Using the Command Line

1. Make sure you have correctly [setup the Scalingo command line tool]({% post_url platform/cli/2000-01-01-start %})
2. From the command line, list the plans available for `postgresql`:
   ```bash
   scalingo addons-plans postgresql
   ```
   The output should look like this:
   ```text
   +----------------------------+---------------+
   |             ID             |     NAME      |
   +----------------------------+---------------+
   | postgresql-sandbox         | Sandbox       |
   | postgresql-starter-512     | Starter 512M  |
   | postgresql-starter-1024    | Starter 1G    |
   ...
   ```
3. Locate the `ID` corresponding to the plan you want to scale to (for example
   `postgresql-business-1024`)
4. List the addons attached to your application:
   ```bash
   scalingo --app my-app addons
   ```
   The output should look like this:
   ```text
   +------------+-----------------------------------------+------------------------+---------+
   |   ADDON    |                   ID                    |          PLAN          | STATUS  |
   +------------+-----------------------------------------+------------------------+---------+
   | PostgreSQL | ad-871546ad-943a-4929-9770-ec7c839d65f5 | postgresql-starter-512 | running |
   ...
   ```
5. Locate the `ID` corresponding to the addon you want to scale
6. Change plan using the `addons-upgrade` sub-command:
   ```bash
   scalingo --app my-app addons-upgrade <addon_ID> <plan_ID>
   ```
   The output should look like this:
   ```text
   -----> Addon ad-d0aa540a-5ed2-41f8-8bbe-91e3aff6623b has been upgraded
          Message from addon provider: Database plan is being changed
   ```

### Using the Terraform Provider

1. Update the `plan` property of the corresponding Resource block in your
   Terraform file to scale the addon:
   ```tf
   resource "scalingo_addon" "my-db" {
     provider_id = "postgresql"
     plan = "postgresql-business-1024"
     app = "${scalingo_app.my-app.id}"
   }
   ```
   In this example, we switch the `my-db` resource attached to the `my-app`
   application to a PostgreSQL Business 1024 addon.
2. Run `terraform plan` and check if the result looks good
3. If so, run `terraform apply`


## Managing Users

By default, Scalingo creates a user with read and write permissions on your
database with the following queries:

```sql
GRANT CREATE ON SCHEMA public TO <username>
GRANT ALL PRIVILEGES ON DATABASE <database> TO <username>
GRANT ALL PRIVILEGES ON ALL TABLES IN SCHEMA public TO <username>
GRANT ALL PRIVILEGES ON ALL SEQUENCES IN SCHEMA public TO <username>
ALTER DEFAULT PRIVILEGES FOR USER <database> IN SCHEMA public GRANT ALL ON TABLES TO <username>
ALTER DEFAULT PRIVILEGES FOR USER <database> IN SCHEMA public GRANT ALL ON SEQUENCES TO <username>
```

{% note %}
It is not possible to delete a protected user or change their password.
{% endnote %}

### Listing Users

#### Using the Database Dashboard

1. From your web browser, [open your database dashboard]({% post_url databases/postgresql/2000-01-01-getting-started %}#accessing-the-postgresql-dashboard)
2. Click the **Settings** tab
3. In the **Settings** submenu, select **Users**
4. The list of available users is displayed in the **User Management** block

#### Using the Command Line

1. Make sure you have correctly [setup the Scalingo command line tool]({% post_url platform/cli/2000-01-01-start %})
2. From the command line, run the following command to list the users:
   ```bash
   scalingo --app my-app --addon postgresql database-users-list
   ```
   The output should look like this:
   ```text
   +----------------+-----------+-----------+---------------------+
   |    USERNAME    | READ-ONLY | PROTECTED | PASSWORD ENCRYPTION |
   +----------------+-----------+-----------+---------------------+
   | my_app_4553    | false     | true      | SCRAM-SHA-256       |
   | my_app_4553_rw | false     | false     | MD5                 |
   | my_app_4553_ro | true      | false     | MD5                 |
   +----------------+-----------+-----------+---------------------+
   ```
   In this example, we can see that the database has 3 users available. One has
   been created along with the addon and is protected, which means it can't be
   removed. Among the two others, one can only read data from the database.
   We can also see the password encryption algorithm.


### Creating a New User

The following restrictions apply when creating a new user, regardless of the
method used:

- Username:
  - Must be between 6 and 32 characters long
  - Can only contain alphanumerical characters and underscores (`_`)
  - Must start with a letter
- Password:
  - Must be between 24 and 64 characters long.
  - Must not contain the character `"` or `'`

#### Using the Database Dashboard

{% note %}
If you want to define a user password, this can only be done via the command line.
{% endnote %}

1. From your web browser, [open your database dashboard]({% post_url databases/postgresql/2000-01-01-getting-started %}#accessing-the-scalingo-for-postgresql-dashboard)
2. Click the **Settings** tab
3. In the **Settings** submenu, select **Users**
4. Fill the **Add a user** form:
   - Fill a username
   - (optional) To allow the new user to have writings abilities, make
     sure to check the **Write (optional)** checkbox
5. Validate by clicking the **Add this user** button

{% note %}
A secure password is generated automatically and shown in a popup window after the user creation.
You will be able to view and copy it only once.
{% endnote %}

#### Using the Command Line

1. Make sure you have correctly [setup the Scalingo command line tool]({% post_url platform/cli/2000-01-01-start %})
2. From the command line, run the following command to create a new user:
   ```bash
   scalingo --app my-app --addon postgresql database-users-create <username>
   ```
   Optionally, if you want to restrict this user to read only abilities, use
   the `--read-only` flag:
   ```bash
   scalingo --app my-app --addon postgresql database-users-create --read-only <username>
   ```
3. Set the user password:
   - Either chose a password and confirm it
   - Or let the platform generate a password by leaving the field empty

   The output should look like this:
   - If you set a password:
   ```text
   User "my_user" created.
   ```
   - If you let the platform generate a password:
   ```text
   User "my_user" created with password "YANs3y07m5_KJC2MSDGebh8tx1lliFWh2Yb239zVqGQvbElWDjIN7QWspVH92Ul8".
   ```

### Updating a User Password

#### Using the Command Line

1. Make sure you have correctly [setup the Scalingo command line tool]({% post_url platform/cli/2000-01-01-start %})
2. Update the user password with the following command:
   ```bash
   scalingo --app my-app --addon postgresql database-users-update-password <username>
   ```
3. An interactive prompt asks you for a password you want to attribute to your user:
   - Either chose a password and confirm it
   - Or let the platform generate a password by leaving the field empty
   The output should look like this:
   - If you set a password:
   ```text
   User "my_user" created.
   ```
   - If you let the platform generate a password:
   ```text
   User "my_user" created with password "YANs3y07m5_KJC2MSDGebh8tx1lliFWh2Yb239zVqGQvbElWDjIN7QWspVH92Ul8".
   ```

   ```

## Managing Extensions

PostgreSQL® is a database engine which is extensible thanks to a large set of
extensions. A lot of them are installed alongside your PostgreSQL® instance,
but you need to enable those manually according to your needs.

Please refer to the Overview page to get the [list of available extensions]({% post_url databases/postgresql/2000-01-01-overview %}#available-extensions).

### Viewing Enabled Extensions

#### Using the Database Dashboard

1. From your web browser, [open your database dashboard]({% post_url databases/postgresql/2000-01-01-getting-started %}#accessing-the-scalingo-for-postgresql-dashboard)
2. Click the **Settings** tab
3. In the **Settings** submenu, select **Configuration**
4.  The list of enabled extensions is displayed in the **PostgreSQL Extensions** block

### Enabling an Extension

#### Using the Command Line

1. Access your database using the [Interactive Remote Console]({% post_url databases/postgresql/2000-01-01-accessing %}#using-the-interactive-remote-console)
2. From the PostgreSQL® console, run the following command:
   ```sql
   CREATE EXTENSION IF NOT EXISTS <extension_name>;
   ```
   The output should look like this:
   ```bash
   CREATE EXTENSION
   my_app_4553=>
   ```

{% note %}
Enabling an extension for your PostgreSQL® is only available from the command
line.
{% endnote %}

### Disabling an Extension

#### Using the Command Line

1. Access your database using the [Interactive Remote Console]({% post_url databases/postgresql/2000-01-01-accessing %}#using-the-interactive-remote-console)
2. From the PostgreSQL® console, run the following command:
   ```sql
   DROP EXTENSION IF EXISTS <extension_name>;
   ```
   The output should look like this:
   ```bash
   DROP EXTENSION
   my_app_4553=>
   ```

{% note %}
Disabling an extension from your PostgreSQL® is only available from the command
line.
{% endnote %}
