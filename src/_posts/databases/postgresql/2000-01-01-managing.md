## Scaling (Changing Plan)



## Upgrading



## Managing Users

By default, Scalingo creates a user with read and write permissions on your
database with the following queries:

```sql
GRANT CREATE ON SCHEMA public TO <username>
GRANT ALL PRIVILEGES ON DATABASE <database> TO <username>
GRANT ALL PRIVILEGES ON ALL TABLES IN SCHEMA public TO <username>
GRANT ALL PRIVILEGES ON ALL SEQUENCES IN SCHEMA public TO <username>
ALTER DEFAULT PRIVILEGES FOR USER <database> IN SCHEMA public GRANT ALL ON TABLES TO <username>
ALTER DEFAULT PRIVILEGES FOR USER <database> IN SCHEMA public GRANT ALL ON SEQUENCES TO <username>
```

### Creating a New User

#### Using the Database Dashboard

1. From your web browser, open your [database dashboard]({% post_url databases/postgresql/2000-01-01-getting-started %}#accessing-the-scalingo-for-postgresql-dashboard)
2. Click the **Users** tab
3. Fill the **Add a new user** form:
   - Fill a username
   - Fill the corresponding password twice
4. (optional) If you want to restrict this user to read only abilities, make
   sure to check the **Read only** checkbox
5. Validate by clicking the **Add User** button

{% note %}
Creating a new database user is only available from the database dashboard.
{% endnote %}

### Deleting an Existing User

#### Using the Database Dashboard

1. From your web browser, open your [database dashboard]({% post_url databases/postgresql/2000-01-01-getting-started %}#accessing-the-scalingo-for-postgresql-dashboard)
2. Click the **Users** tab
3. Locate the user you want to remove
4. Click the **Delete** button next to the user
5. Confirm the removal

{% note %}
Removing a database user is only available from the database dashboard.
{% endnote %}


## Managing Extensions

PostgreSQL® is a database engine which is extensible thanks to a large set of
extensions. A lot of them are installed alongside your Scalingo for PostgreSQL®
instance, but you need to enable those manually according to your needs.

Please refer to the Overview page to get the [list of available extensions]({% post_url databases/postgresql/2000-01-01-overview %}#available-extensions).

### Enabling an Extension

#### Using the Command Line

1. Access your database using the [Interactive Remote Console]({% post_url databases/postgresql/2000-01-01-accessing %}#using-the-interactive-remote-console)
2. From the PostgreSQL® console, run the following command:
   ```sql
   CREATE extension <extension_name>;
   ```
   The output should look like this:
   ```bash
   CREATE EXTENSION
   my_app_4553=>
   ```
3. [Exit the Interactive Remote Console]({% post_url databases/postgresql/2000-01-01-accessing %}#exiting)

{% note %}
For now, enabling an extension for your Scalingo for PostgreSQL® is only
available from the Command Line.
{% endnote %}
