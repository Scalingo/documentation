PostGIS is an open-source extension to PostgreSQL® designed to add support for
storing, indexing and querying geographic data.

This extension adds several features and functions, such as geometric and
geographic processing, geocoding, topologies and raster processing. You can find
more information on the [official documentation][official_doc].


## PostGIS at Scalingo

PostGIS has some particularities which you should be aware of before getting
started.

- PostGIS requires quite a lot of resources to run properly. We strongly advise
  to use at least a Starter 512 plan.


## Enabling PostGIS

To enable PostGIS:
1. [Provision a new PostgreSQL® database][provisioning]
2. Access your database using the [Interactive Remote Console][irc]
3. [Enable the `postgis` extension][enabling-extension] using the following commands:

    From the PostgreSQL® console, run the following command:

    ```sql
    CREATE EXTENSION IF NOT EXISTS postgis;
    ```

    The output should look like this:

    ```bash
    CREATE EXTENSION
    my_app_4553=>
    ```

4. PostGIS is now enabled and ready to be used!
