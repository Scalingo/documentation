## PostgreSQL®

PostgreSQL® is a free, open-source, community-managed object-relational
database management system (ORDBMS) focusing on SQL compliance and
extensibility. It is well-known for its performances, reliability and
robustness, making it a very powerful database, able to hanlde small to huge
workloads.

Besides the core features (ACID transactions, views, triggers, foreign keys,
...) PostgreSQL® also offers solutions for more specialized usages, such as
object storage with the native `jsonb` format, or for specific dataset kinds,
such as geographic datasets with the PostGIS extension or for time-series
datasets with TimescaleDB.


## Scalingo for PostgreSQL®

Scalingo for PostgreSQL® is our official PostgreSQL® addon. [We have several
plans available](https://scalingo.com/databases/postgresql#database-compare),
which you can chose of depending on your needs and budget. As always, a free
plan is available for you to test our offer during a limited amount of time.

### Features

All our plans are fully managed. They allow you to enable the available
extensions, and allow you to scale your database to another plan.

They also include access to metrics and logs, allowing for quick and easy
monitoring and auditing. For more information regarding this topic, please [see
our dedicated page]({% post_url databases/postgresql/2000-01-01-monitoring %}).

From the security point of view, they all come with a TLS connection and
encryption at rest.

In addition to the above, Starter plans include daily on-demand backups, as
well as 7-days Point-in-time Recovery (PITR) backups. All backups are encrypted
and stored externally. For more information regarding this topic, please
[see our dedicated page]({% post_url databases/postgresql/2000-01-01-backing-up %}).

For the most demanding environments, our Business plans include a fully-managed
cluster made of 2 PostgreSQL® nodes (one primary and one replica) and 2 HAProxy
(one primary and one backup) as entrypoint to your cluster private network.
The communication between the PostgreSQL® nodes is encrypted. Chosing such a
plan drastically lowers the risk of unavailability, be it during a maintenance
operation (database upgrade, for example) or because of a platform issue.

### Available Version

The latest version of PostgreSQL® available is **`14.8.0-1`**.

This is also the default version when attaching a Scalingo for PostgreSQL®
addon to your application.


### Available Extensions

{% include database_postgresql_extensions.md %}

### Billing

Billing of your Scalingo for PostgreSQL® addon is done on a minute basis.

If your database disk usage exceeds the threshold set on your plan, the
over-quota is billed per GB-hour ([see our FAQ further details](https://scalingo.com/databases/postgresql)).

The prices are detailed on
[our dedicated page](https://scalingo.com/databases/postgresql).
