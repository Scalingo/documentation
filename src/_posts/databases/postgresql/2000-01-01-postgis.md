PostGIS is an open-source extension to PostgreSQL® designed to add support for
storing, indexing and querying geographic data.

This extension adds several features and functions, such as geometric and
geographic processing, geocoding, topologies and raster processing. You can find
more information on the [official documentation](https://postgis.net/documentation/).

## PostGIS at Scalingo

{% note %}
PostGIS has some specificities which you should be aware of before getting
started.

- PostGIS requires quite a lot of resources to run properly. We strongly advise
  to use at least a Starter 512 plan.
