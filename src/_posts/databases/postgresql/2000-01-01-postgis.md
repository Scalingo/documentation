PostGIS is an open-source extension to PostgreSQL® designed to add support for
storing, indexing and querying geographic data.

This extension adds several features and functions, such as geometric and
geographic processing, geocoding, topologies and raster processing. You can find
more information on the [official documentation](https://postgis.net/documentation/).
