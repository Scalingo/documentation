Remotely accessing your Scalingo for MSQL® database can sometimes be useful,
for example, to conduct investigations, to check or compute data locally, to
dump the database content,...

We provide several ways to access your database remotely. Chosing one mostly
depends on your needs and preferences.

## Using the Interactive Remote Console

1. Make sure you have correctly [setup the Scalingo command line tool]({% post_url platform/cli/2000-01-01-start %})
2. From the command line, open a console for your MySQL® addon:
   ```bash
   scalingo --app my-app mysql-console
   ```
   The output should look like this:
   ```bash
   -----> Starting container one-off-7872  Done in 0.479 seconds
   -----> Connecting to container [one-off-7872]...  
   -----> Process 'mysql-console my_app_4553' is starting...  

   ---> Download and extract the database CLI
   ---> Database CLI installed:
   mysql  Ver 8.0.33 for Linux on x86_64 (Source distribution)
   mysql: [Warning] Using a password on the command line interface can be insecure.
   Welcome to the MySQL monitor.  Commands end with ; or \g.
   Your MySQL connection id is 496
   Server version: 8.0.35 MySQL Community Server - GPL

   owners.
   
   Type 'help;' or '\h' for help. Type '\c' to clear the current input statement.
   
   mysql>
   ```
3. To exit, type the following command from the MySQL® console, or use the
   keyboard shortcut `CTRL`+`D`:
   ```bash
   \q
   ```


## Using a One-Off

1. [Start a one-off container]({% post_url platform/app/2000-01-01-tasks %})
2. From the command line, use our `dbclient-fetcher` helper to download and
   install a bunch of MySQL® tools:
   ```bash
   dbclient-fetcher mysql
   ```
   The output should look like this:
   ```text
   ---> Download and extract the database CLI
   ---> Database CLI installed:
   mysql  Ver 8.0.33 for Linux on x86_64 (Source distribution)
   ```
3. If you ever need a specific version, just add it as a second parameter:
   ```bash
   dbclient-fetcher mysql 8
   ```
   The output should look like this:
   ```text
   ---> Download and extract the database CLI
   ---> Database CLI installed:
   mysql  Ver 8.0.35 for Linux on x86_64 (Source distribution)
   ```

The `dbclient-fetcher` helper installs the following tools:
- `mysql`
- `mysqldump`


## Using Third Party Tools

While using `mysql` to query and administer a MySQL® database is probably the
ubiquitous choice for a lot of users, it's not limited to that. The MySQL®
ecosystem indeed offers a very large panel of tools made and provided by
third-parties. For example, some might feel more intuitive because of their
Graphical User Interface. Some are better integrated with others tools, when
some others are more data-visualization centric.

By default, and for security reasons, your MySQL® database is not directly
accessible from the Internet and therefore not directly usable with your
third-party tool.

To access your database remotely you first need to [make it reachable over the
Internet](#making-the-database-reachable-over-internet):
- either locally, on your computer, via an [encrypted tunnel](#setting-up-an-encrypted-tunnel)
- or from any location, by [enforcing TLS connection]({% post_url databases/mysql/2000-01-01-connecting %}#enforcing-tls-connection)
  and [enabling direct Internet access](#enabling-direct-access-over-internet).

Once a secured connection has been established, you should be able to connect
to your database with your tool of choice. If you don't have one yet, we
suggest you to take a look at [DBeaver](#using-dbeaver) or
[MySQL Workbench](#using-mysql-workbench).

###  Making the Database Reachable Over Internet

#### Using Our Command Line Tool

Our command line tool provides a `db-tunnel` command that creates an SSH
encrypted tunnel between the computer running the command and our platform,
allowing remote secured access to your MySQL® addon.

1. Make sure you have correctly [setup the Scalingo command line tool]({% post_url platform/cli/2000-01-01-start %})
2. Make sure you have correctly [setup SSH authentication]({% post_url platform/getting-started/2000-01-01-first-steps %})
   on your Scalingo account
3. From the command line, open the tunnel using this command:
   ```bash
   scalingo --app my-app db-tunnel SCALINGO_MYSQL_URL
   ```
   The output should look like this:
   ```text
   Building tunnel to my-app-4553.mysql.a.osc-fr1.scalingo-dbs.com:35581
   You can access your database on:
   127.0.0.1:10000
   ```
4. The database is now reachable from `127.0.0.1` on port `10000`
5. To specify the port number to bind to (default is `10000`), use the `--port`
   option:
   ```bash
   scalingo --app my-app db-tunnel SCALINGO_MYSQL_URL --port 12345
   ```
6. To close the tunnel, use the keyboard shortcut `CTRL`+`C`:
   ```text
   ^Cinterrupt catched, aborting…
   ```

#### Using OpenSSH

Our command line tool [handles it in a single command](#using-our-command-line-tool),
but you might want to use the tunnel without it. With the standard OpenSSH
client, the way to build the tunnel is:

1. Identify the [connection URI]({% post_url databases/mysql/2000-01-01-connecting %}#getting-the-connection-uri)
   for your database
2. Make sure to [understand how the connection URI is built]({% post_url databases/mysql/2000-01-01-connecting %}#understanding-the-connection-uri)
3. From the command line, run the following command to create the tunnel:
   ```bash
   ssh -L <local_port>:<db_url>:<db_port> git@<ssh_hostname> -p 22 -N
   ```
   With:
   - `local_port`: local port number you want to bind to
   - `db_url`: URL of your database, from the environment variable
   - `db_port`: port
   - `ssh_hostname`: depends on your region:
     - For `osc-fr1`: `ssh.osc-fr1.scalingo.com`
     - For `osc-secnum-fr1`: `ssh.osc-secnum-fr1.scalingo.com`
   - (the SSH user is always `git` and the SSH port is always `22`)

   The output should stay blank
4. The database is now reachable from `127.0.0.1` on `local_port`

#### Enabling Direct Access Over Internet

{% warning %}
For various security reasons, we strongly discourage exposing databases on the
Internet. This is often considered a bad practice. Consequently, we do not
recommend activating Internet Accessibility.
{% endwarning %}

1. Make sure [you have TLS enforced]({% post_url databases/mysql/2000-01-01-connecting %}#enforcing-tls-connection)
2. From your web browser, [open your database dashboard]({% post_url databases/mysql/2000-01-01-getting-started %}#accessing-the-scalingo-for-mysql-dashboard)
3. Select the **Overview** tab
4. Locate the **TLS/Internet Access** block
5. Enable the **Internet Accessibility** option
6. The database is now available using the corresponding [connection URI]({% post_url databases/mysql/2000-01-01-connecting %})

### Using DBeaver

[DBeaver](https://dbeaver.io/) is a free and open-source database tool allowing
to manage multiple database kinds, including MySQL®. It includes a carefully
designed and implemented User Interface, as well as a lot of features such as
the ability to execute SQL queries with autocompletion and syntax highlighting,
the ability to browse and edit database structure, data import/export, etc.

#### Accessing Through a DB Tunnel
