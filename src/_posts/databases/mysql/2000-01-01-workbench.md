## Requirements

Scalingo for MySQL速 databases are not by default directly available on the
Internet. To access it, a solution is to setup an [encrypted tunnel]({% post_url
platform/databases/2000-01-01-access %}).

MySQL速 Workbench lets you configure this tunnel. We will guide through the steps
to configure the connection to a Scalingo for MySQL速 addon through an encrypted
tunnel.

## Database Configuration

### Authentication

The connection data can be found from the `SCALINGO_MYSQL_URL` environment
variable of your application.

```
$ scalingo env | grep SCALINGO_MYSQL_URL
SCALINGO_MYSQL_URL=mysql://my_app_3030:CaUrq1MdUkAzCSEq-1Fg@my-app-3030.mysql.a.osc-fr1.scalingo-dbs.com:30999/my_app_3030
```

In this case:

* Hostname: my-app-3030.mysql.a.osc-fr1.scalingo-dbs.com
* Port: 30999
* User: my_app_3030
* Password: CaUrq1MdUkAzCSEq-1Fg
* Database: my_app_3030

You first need to select "Standard TCP/IP over SSH" as "Connection Method".
Then, fill the fields accordingly:

{% assign width = "450px" %}
{% assign img_url = "https://cdn.scalingo.com/documentation/mysql-workbench/connection_ssh_tunnel.png" %}
{% include mdl_img.html %}

### Configuring SSH

The "SSH Key File" should target the private key associated to the public key you've added in the "SSH" tab on your Scalingo Profile.

The "SSH Username" is always `git`.

The "SSH Hostname" and "SSH Port" depends on the region your database is
deployed on:

{% include ssh_endpoints.md %}
