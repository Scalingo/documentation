When a Scalingo for MySQL® addon is provisioned, the platform also adds
two [environment variables]({% post_url platform/app/2000-01-01-environment %})
to your app:

- `SCALINGO_MYSQL_URL`: a string containing all information needed to
  establish a connection between your application and your database. This
  string is called a **connection URI**.
- `DATABASE_URL`: an alias for `SCALINGO_MYSQL_URL`.


## Understanding the Connection URI

The connection URI is made of several **components** separated one from each
other by a **delimiter**. For example, the `@` character is used to mark the
end of the *userinfo* (credentials) component of the URI.

In the case of MySQL®, the connection URI provided by Scalingo is always
formed as follows:

```bash
mysql://[user]:[password]@[url]:[port]/[dbname]?useSSL=true&verifyServerCertificate=false
```

For more information about the connection URI syntax, please see
[RFC 3986](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc3986) which defines the URI
Generic Syntax.


## Using the Connection URI

**We strongly advise to use one of the two environment variables available to
connect your application to your database**. Please don't use the value, but
the environment variable itself.

While the value of the provided connection URI **should not** change over time,
**we don't guarantee it**. For example, the URI could change for maintenance
reasons. In such a case, using the environment variable guarantees that your
application can restart successfully without human intervention. Otherwise, you
would have to update your code with the new value and trigger a new deployment,
which would most probably contribute to a bigger downtime.

In most cases, you can pass the environment variable directly to the client
library you are using. But sometimes, the library requires a specific URI
format, invididual keypairs or another format. In such cases, your code
needs to parse the connection URI to retrieve the different values and build
what's required by the library. Our advice to use the environment variable
still remains applicable.


## Getting the Connection URI

### Using the Dashboard

1. From your web browser, open your [dashboard](https://dashboard.scalingo.com)
2. Click on the application for which you want to get the connection URI
3. Click on the **Environment** tab
4. Locate the `SCALINGO_MYSQL_URL` line and place your mouse over it to unblur
   the value

### Using the Command Line

1. Make sure you have correctly [setup the Scalingo command line tool]({% post_url platform/cli/2000-01-01-start %})
2. From the command line, get the environment variable value:
   ```bash
   scalingo --app my-app env-get SCALINGO_MYSQL_URL
   ```
   The output should look like:
   ```bash
   mysql://my_app_wxyz:Q7X7CU2vGjFiLZrA43OG@YANs3y07m5_KJC2MSDGebh8tx1lliFWh2Yb239zVqGQvbElWDjIN7QWspVH92Ul8.my-app-wxyz.mysql.a.osc-fr1.scalingo-dbs.com:31000/my_app_wxyz?useSSL=true&verifyServerCertificate=false
   ```


## Enforcing TLS Connection

All MySQL® addons [support TLS](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.0/en/encrypted-connections.html)
to encrypt all the network traffic between the client and the server.

By default, all new MySQL® databases have TLS **available**,
which means that you don't have to do anything to connect via TLS with a tool
or library that uses TLS by default.

If you want to enforce TLS connections to your database so that TLS is
not only available, but **mandatory**:

1. From your web browser, [open your database dashboard]({% post_url databases/mysql/2000-01-01-getting-started %}#accessing-the-scalingo-for-mysql-dashboard)
2. Select the **Settings** tab
3. In the Settings submenu, select **Internet Access**
4. Locate the **Force TLS connections** block
5. Click the **Enable** button

Once this option is activated, the database denies any non-TLS connection.
Consequently, your application must be configured to use TLS when connecting to
the database.

Please note that while we strongly advise to use TLS, it remains an option,
meaning that you can still access your database without it if needed.


## Connecting Multiple Applications to the Same MySQL® Addon

It's possible to make multiple applications use the same MySQL® addon. To do
so, add an environment variable in every application that needs to connect to
the database, like so:

1. Copy [the connection URI](#getting-the-connection-uri) of your addon
2. [Create a new environment variable]({% post_url platform/app/2000-01-01-environment %})
   for the application that needs to connect to the addon
3. Set the value of this new environment variable to connection URI you just
   copied
4. Restart the application to make the new environment variable available
5. Remember to update this new environment variable whenever the original
   connection URI changes

## Using Ruby on Rails

When using Ruby on Rails, the buildpack reads the `DATABASE_URL` environment
variable (which is an alias for `SCALINGO_MYSQL_URL`), parses it and creates
the `database.yml` configuration file accordingly and automatically.

If you're using the <em>mysql2</em> gem, you will need to copy the value of
`SCALINGO_MYSQL_URL` into `DATABASE_URL` and change the scheme part from
`mysql://` to `mysql2://`.
