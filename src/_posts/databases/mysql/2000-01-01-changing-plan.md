At Scalingo, all databases addons plans are identified using a name made of two
or three parts separated by a dash (-). This name is made of:

1. a database ***type*** : `mysql`
2. a ***class*** : either `sandbox`, `starter` or `business` (learn more about
   [classes]({% post_url databases/2000-01-01-overview %}#database-plans))
3. a ***size*** : specifying the amount of RAM available with the plan, in MB
   (only for starter and business classes).

You can change your Scalingo for MySQL® addon plan whenever you want. The
operation is launched instantly, no manual input is required.

The impact on your application and the downtime vary depending on several
factors such as the current plan being used and the one you wish to change for
(see below for further information).

{% warning %}
While switching to a more powerful plan is rather safe, you should take extra
care when changing for a less powerful plan: please make sure the new plan can
handle all your data and fits your application workload.

## Understanding the Plan Change Process

### From Starter to Starter

When changing the size of a Starter plan, the platform reboots the existing
instance with the new size. This leads to a small service interruption
during which the database is not available. This shouldn't exceed a few seconds
though.

| From (class) | To (class) | To (size) | Downtime | Duration     |
| ------------ | ---------- | --------- | -------- | ------------ |
| Starter      | Starter    | Any       | **Yes**  | 2-10 seconds |

### From Starter to Business

When changing for a Business plan, the platform starts additional instances
with the targeted size. If necessary, it then reboots the previously existing
instance with the targeted size. There should be no downtime at all, thanks to
the failover mechanism included with the Business plan.

| From (class) | To (class) | To (size) | Downtime | Duration     |
| ------------ | ---------- | --------- | -------- | ------------ |
| Starter      | Business   | Any       | **No**   | Zero         |

### From Business to Starter

When changing for a lower class, the platform first powers the surplus
instances off. When necessary, the remaining instance is rebooted with the
targeted new size. This can lead to a small service interruption during which
the database is not available. This shouldn't exceed a few seconds though.

| From (class) | To (class) | To (size) | Downtime | Duration     |
| ------------ | ---------- | --------- | -------- | ------------ |
| Business     | Starter    | Same      | **No**   | Zero         |
| Business     | Starter    | Larger    | **Yes**  | 2-10 seconds |
| Business     | Starter    | Smaller   | **Yes**  | 2-10 seconds |

### From Business to Business

When changing the size of a Business plan, the platform reboots the instances
with the targeted new size one by one. There's no downtime during this
operation, thanks to the high availability mechanism included in the Business
plan.

| From (class) | To (class) | To (size) | Downtime | Duration     |
| ------------ | ---------- | --------- | -------- | ------------ |
| Business     | Business   | Any       | **No**   | Zero         |


## Using the Dashboard

1. From your web browser, open your [dashboard](https://dashboard.scalingo.com/apps)
2. Click on the application for which you want to scale the Scalingo for
   MySQL® addon
3. Click on the **Resources** tab
4. Locate the **Addons** block and click on the **"&#8230;"** button
5. From the dropdown menu, select **Change plan**
6. Select the new plan
7. Click the **Finish** button
8. Validate by clicking the **Confirm plan change** button


## Using the Database Dashboard

1. From your web browser, [open your database dashboard]({% post_url databases/mysql/2000-01-01-getting-started %}#accessing-the-mysql-dashboard)
2. Click the **Settings** tab
3. In **General**, locate the **Database Plan** block
4. In this block, click the **Change plan** button
5. Select the new plan
6. Click the **Finish** button
7. Validate by clicking the **Confirm plan change** button


## Using the Command Line

1. Make sure you have correctly [setup the Scalingo command line tool]({% post_url platform/cli/2000-01-01-start %})
2. From the command line, list the plans available for `mysql`:
   ```bash
   scalingo addons-plans mysql
   ```
   The output should look like this:
   ```text
   +-----------------------+---------------+
   |          ID           |     NAME      |
   +-----------------------+---------------+
   | mysql-sandbox         | Sandbox       |
   | mysql-starter-512     | Starter 512M  |
   | mysql-starter-1024    | Starter 1G    |
   ...
   ```
3. Locate the `ID` corresponding to the plan you want to scale to (for example
   `mysql-business-1024`)
4. Change plan using the `addons-upgrade` sub-command:
   ```bash
   scalingo --app my-app addons-upgrade mysql <plan_ID>
   ```
   The output should look like this:
   ```text
   -----> Addon ad-d0aa540a-5ed2-41f8-8bbe-91e3aff6623b has been upgraded
          Message from addon provider: Database plan is being changed
   ```


## Using the Terraform Provider

1. Update the `plan` property of the corresponding Resource block in your
   Terraform file to scale the addon:
   ```tf
   resource "scalingo_addon" "my-db" {
     provider_id = "mysql"
     plan = "mysql-business-1024"
     app = "${scalingo_app.my-app.id}"
   }
   ```
   In this example, we switch the `my-db` resource attached to the `my-app`
   application to a MySQL® Business 1024 addon.
