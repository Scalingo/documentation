## Scaling (Changing Plan)

You can change your database plan whenever you want. This operation happens
instantly, no manual input is required. When you change the plan, the instances
of your database are stopped and then restarted with the characteristics of the
chosen plan. According to the type of plan you are originally using, the impact
on your application differs:
- **Starter Plans**: Since these plans are not highly available, expect some
  unavailability during which the scale operations are conducted. The duration
  highly depends on the database size (from seconds to several hours).
- **Business Plans**: Thanks to high availability, only a failover occurs
  during the operation. Current connections are stopped and the application has
  to reconnect. It can be transparent or lead to a ~2-5 seconds interruption,
  depending on the driver used by your application and its configuration.

{% note %}
  Business Plans are only available starting with MySQL® 8.\
  Consider [upgrading to MySQL® 8](#upgrading-to-mysql-8) if you want to
  benefit from high availability with MySQL®.
{% endnote %}

In both cases, once the operation is finished, the application is restarted to
ensure it creates new healthy connections to the database.

{% warning %}
While upscaling (changing for a more powerful plan) is rather safe, you should
take extra care when downscaling: please make sure the new plan can handle all
your data and fits your application workload.
{% endwarning %}

### Using the Dashboard

1. From your web browser, open your [dashboard](https://dashboard.scalingo.com/apps)
2. Click on the application for which you want to scale the Scalingo for
   MySQL® addon
3. Click on the **Resources** tab
4. Locate the **Addons** block and click on the **...** button
5. From the dropdown menu, select **Change plan**
6. Select the new plan
7. Click the **Finish** button
8. Validate by clicking the **Confirm plan change** button

### Using the Command Line

1. Make sure you have correctly [setup the Scalingo command line tool]({% post_url platform/cli/2000-01-01-start %})
2. From the command line, list the plans available for `mysql`:
   ```bash
   scalingo addons-plans mysql
   ```
   The output should look like this:
   ```text
   +-----------------------+---------------+
   |          ID           |     NAME      |
   +-----------------------+---------------+
   | mysql-sandbox         | Sandbox       |
   | mysql-starter-512     | Starter 512M  |
   | mysql-starter-1024    | Starter 1G    |
   ...
   ```
3. Locate the `ID` corresponding to the plan you want to scale to (for example
   `mysql-business-1024`)
4. List the addons attached to your application:
   ```bash
   scalingo --app my-app addons
   ```
   The output should look like this:
   ```text
   +-------+-----------------------------------------+-------------------+---------+
   | ADDON |                   ID                    |       PLAN        | STATUS  |
   +-------+-----------------------------------------+-------------------+---------+
   | MySQL | ad-871546ad-943a-4929-9770-ec7c839d65f5 | mysql-starter-512 | running |
   ...
   ```
5. Locate the `ID` corresponding to the addon you want to scale
6. Change plan using the `addons-upgrade` sub-command:
   ```bash
   scalingo --app my-app addons-upgrade <addon_ID> <plan_ID>
   ```
   The output should look like this:
   ```text
   -----> Addon ad-d0aa540a-5ed2-41f8-8bbe-91e3aff6623b has been upgraded
          Message from addon provider: Database plan is being changed
   ```

### Using the Terraform Provider

1. Update the `plan` property of the corresponding Resource block in your
   Terraform file to scale the addon:
   ```tf
   resource "scalingo_addon" "my-db" {
     provider_id = "mysql"
     plan = "mysql-business-1024"
     app = "${scalingo_app.my-app.id}"
   }
   ```
   In this example, we switch the `my-db` resource attached to the `my-app`
   application to a MySQL Business 1024 addon.
2. Run `terraform plan` and check if the result looks good
3. If so, run `terraform apply`


## Upgrading

Upgrading your MySQL® addon consists in changing the database version for
a newer one.

When the database vendor releases a new version of your database engine, we
take some time to study it and test it thoroughly before making it available.
Upgrading to this new version is still your choice. We don't do it
automatically.

{% warning %}
Beware that no downgrade is possible once your database has been upgraded.
{% endwarning %}

Your database needs to be upgraded to the latest minor version before having
access to the next major version. For instance, let's imagine that your version
is `2.3.x` and you want to upgrade to `3.1.x`. If there is a `2.5.x` version
available, you first need to upgrade your database to the `2.5.x` version
before upgrading to the `3.1.x` version.

{% note %}
There are a couple more prerequisites when upgrading from MySQL® 5.7 to 8.0.
Please make sure to check [these mandatory prerequisites](#upgrading-to-mysql-8).\
Upgrading to MySQL 8.0 is mandatory to benefit from MySQL high availability via
Business Plans.
{% endnote %}

During the upgrade, a downtime can unfortunately happen, depending on the Plan
you are using and the upgrade:
- **Starter Plans**: In all cases, we have to stop the node to upgrade it,
  causing an inevitable downtime.
- **Business Plans**: We are able to achieve zero-downtime upgrade of
  minor version. In the case of major version upgrade, we need to completely
  stop the nodes, hence causing an inevitable downtime.

In both cases, once the operation is finished, the application is restarted.

### Using the Database Dashboard

1. From your web browser, open your [database dashboard]({% post_url databases/mysql/2000-01-01-getting-started %}#accessing-the-scalingo-for-mysql-dashboard)
2. Click the **Overview** tab
3. Locate the **Database Upgrade** block
4. If an upgrade is available, the text in the block explains what will be
   done.
5. To launch the upgrade, click the **Upgrade to ...** button

{% note %}
Upgrading a MySQL® addon to a newer version is only available through the
database dashboard.
{% endnote %}

### Upgrading to MySQL® 8

Starting with MySQL® 8, Scalingo enables group replication on all MySQL®
databases. This MySQL® feature has a couple of [strong prerequisites](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.0/en/group-replication-requirements.html).
Please make sure your database is compatible before proceeding with the
upgrade:

#### Checking the Storage Engine

All tables **must** use the InnoDB storage engine. You can check which tables
use a different storage engine with the following SQL statement:

```sql
SELECT table_schema, table_name FROM information_schema.tables \
  WHERE table_schema IN ('my-app-3030') AND engine != 'InnoDB';
```

Here is the output if the `foo` table uses a storage engine other than InnoDB:

```text
+--------------+------------+
| table_schema | table_name |
+--------------+------------+
| my-app-3030  | foo        |
+--------------+------------+
1 row in set (0.00 sec)
```

In such a case, you need to update `foo`'s storage engine with the following
SQL statement:

```sql
ALTER TABLE 'foo' ENGINE = 'InnoDB';
```

#### Checking Mandatory Primary Keys

All tables **must** have a primary key configured. You can check which tables
do not have any primary key with the following SQL statement:

```sql
SELECT information_schema.tables.table_schema, information_schema.tables.table_name \
  FROM information_schema.tables LEFT JOIN information_schema.key_column_usage AS c ON (\
    information_schema.tables.table_name = c.table_name AND \
    c.constraint_schema = information_schema.tables.table_schema AND \
    c.constraint_name = 'PRIMARY' \
  ) \
  WHERE information_schema.tables.table_schema IN ('my-app-3030') AND \
  information_schema.tables.table_type != "VIEW" AND \
  c.constraint_name IS NULL;
```

Here is the output if the `foo` table does not have a primary key:

```text
+--------------+------------+
| table_schema | table_name |
+--------------+------------+
| my-app-3030  | foo        |
+--------------+------------+
1 row in set (0.00 sec)
```

In such a case, you need to add a primary key to the `foo` table. You need to
evaluate the impact of this modification before proceeding. Here is an example
SQL statement to add a new column and set it as primary:

```sql
ALTER TABLE 'foo' ADD COLUMN <column description> PRIMARY KEY;
```

#### One Command Script

Below is a script that can be run directly on the database to:
- create missing primary keys for the concerned tables
- set the engine to InnoDB for the concerned tables

The script creates two procedures, one for each previous actions.

{% warning %}
As always, we highly recommend to make a backup before executing the script.
{% endwarning %}

```sql
DELIMITER $$
DROP PROCEDURE IF EXISTS `create_missing_pk`$$

CREATE PROCEDURE `create_missing_pk`()
BEGIN

DECLARE v_finished INTEGER DEFAULT 0;
DECLARE v_table VARCHAR(100) DEFAULT "";
DECLARE stmt VARCHAR(500) DEFAULT "";

-- get the list of tables without PK
DECLARE table_cursor CURSOR FOR
SELECT i.table_name \
  FROM information_schema.tables AS i LEFT JOIN information_schema.key_column_usage AS c ON (\
    i.table_name = c.table_name AND \
    c.constraint_schema = i.table_schema AND \
    c.constraint_name = 'PRIMARY' \
  ) \
  WHERE i.table_schema \
    NOT IN ('information_schema', 'performance_schema', 'sys', 'mysql', 'mysql_innodb_cluster_metadata') AND \
    i.table_type != "VIEW" AND \

    SET @prepstmt = CONCAT('ALTER TABLE ',v_table,' ENGINE = "InnoDB";');

    PREPARE stmt FROM @prepstmt;
    EXECUTE stmt;
    DEALLOCATE PREPARE stmt;

END LOOP alter_tables;

CLOSE table_cursor;

END$$
DELIMITER ;

-- then call the procedures
call create_missing_pk;
call set_innodb_engine;

-- clear procedures
DROP PROCEDURE IF EXISTS `create_missing_pk`;
DROP PROCEDURE IF EXISTS `set_innodb_engine`;

-- check the current configuration of table
SELECT i.table_schema, i.table_name, i.engine, c.constraint_name  \
  FROM information_schema.tables AS i LEFT JOIN information_schema.key_column_usage AS c ON (\
    i.table_name = c.table_name AND \
    c.constraint_schema = i.table_schema AND \
    c.constraint_name = 'PRIMARY' \
  ) \
  WHERE i.table_schema not in ('information_schema', 'performance_schema', 'sys', 'mysql', 'mysql_innodb_cluster_metadata');
```


## Managing Users

By default, Scalingo creates a user with read and write permissions on your
database with the following queries:

```sql
GRANT ALL PRIVILEGES ON <username>.* TO '<username>'@'%'
```

### Listing Users

#### Using the Database Dashboard

1. From your web browser, open your [database dashboard]({% post_url databases/mysql/2000-01-01-getting-started %}#accessing-the-scalingo-for-mysql-dashboard)
2. Click the **Users** tab
3. The list of available users is displayed under the **User Management**
   section

#### Using the Command Line

1. Make sure you have correctly [setup the Scalingo command line tool]({% post_url platform/cli/2000-01-01-start %})
2. From the command line, list the addons attached to your app:
   ```bash
   scalingo --app my-app addons
   ```
   The output should look like this:
   ```text
   +-------+-----------------------------------------+-------------------+---------+
   | ADDON |                   ID                    |       PLAN        | STATUS  |
   +-------+-----------------------------------------+-------------------+---------+
   | MySQL | ad-3e7b33e1-6e98-4c3c-85a8-58d814b96482 | mysql-starter-512 | running |
   +-------+-----------------------------------------+-------------------+---------+
   ```
3. Locate the `ID` of the addon for which you want to list users
4. From the command line, run the following command to list the users:
   ```bash
   scalingo --app my-app --addon <addon_id> database-users-list
   ```
   The output should look like this:
   ```text
   +----------------+-----------+-----------+
   |    USERNAME    | READ-ONLY | PROTECTED |
   +----------------+-----------+-----------+
   | my_app_4553    | false     | true      |
   | my_app_4553_rw | false     | false     |
   | my_app_4553_ro | true      | false     |
   +----------------+-----------+-----------+
   ```
   In this example, we can see that the database has 3 users available. One has
   been created along with the addon and is protected, which means it can't be
   removed. Among the two others, one can only read data from the database.

### Creating a New User

The following restrictions apply when creating a new user, regardless of the
method you use:

- Username:
  - Must be between 6 and 16 characters long
  - Can only contain alphanumerical characters and underscores (`_`)
  - Must start with a letter
- Password:
  - Must be between 8 and 64 characters long.
  - Must not contain the character `"` or `'`

#### Using the Database Dashboard

1. From your web browser, open your [database dashboard]({% post_url databases/mysql/2000-01-01-getting-started %}#accessing-the-scalingo-for-mysql-dashboard)
2. Click the **Users** tab
3. Fill the **Add a new user** form:
   - Fill a username
   - Fill the corresponding password twice
4. (optional) If you want to restrict this user to read only abilities, make
   sure to check the **Read only** checkbox
5. Validate by clicking the **Add User** button

#### Using the Command Line

1. Make sure you have correctly [setup the Scalingo command line tool]({% post_url platform/cli/2000-01-01-start %})
2. From the command line, list the addons attached to your app:
   ```bash
   scalingo --app my-app addons
   ```
   The output should look like this:
   ```text
   +-------+-----------------------------------------+-------------------+---------+
   | ADDON |                   ID                    |       PLAN        | STATUS  |
   +-------+-----------------------------------------+-------------------+---------+
   | MySQL | ad-3e7b33e1-6e98-4c3c-85a8-58d814b96482 | mysql-starter-512 | running |
   +-------+-----------------------------------------+-------------------+---------+
   ```
3. Locate the `ID` of the addon for which you want to add a user
4. From the command line, run the following command to create a new user:
   ```bash
   scalingo --app my-app --addon <addon_id> database-users-create <username>
   ```
   Optionally, if you want to restrict this user to read only abilities, use
   the `--read-only` flag:
   ```bash
   scalingo --app my-app --addon <addon_id> database-users-create --read-only <username>
   ```
5. Set the user password:
   - Either chose a password and confirm it
   - Or let the platform generate a password by leaving the field empty

   The output should look like this:
   - If you set a password:
   ```text
   User "my_user" created.
   ```
   - If you let the platform generate a password:
   ```text
   User "my_user" created with password "YANs3y07m5_KJC2MSDGebh8tx1lliFWh2Yb239zVqGQvbElWDjIN7QWspVH92Ul8".
   ```

### Deleting an Existing User

#### Using the Database Dashboard

1. From your web browser, open your [database dashboard]({% post_url databases/mysql/2000-01-01-getting-started %}#accessing-the-scalingo-for-mysql-dashboard)
2. Click the **Users** tab
3. Locate the user you want to remove
4. Click the **Delete** button next to the user
5. Confirm the removal

#### Using the Command Line

1. Make sure you have correctly [setup the Scalingo command line tool]({% post_url platform/cli/2000-01-01-start %})
2. From the command line, list the addons attached to your app:
   ```bash
   scalingo --app my-app addons
   ```
   The output should look like this:
   ```text
   +-------+-----------------------------------------+-------------------+---------+
   | ADDON |                   ID                    |       PLAN        | STATUS  |
   +-------+-----------------------------------------+-------------------+---------+
   | MySQL | ad-3e7b33e1-6e98-4c3c-85a8-58d814b96482 | mysql-starter-512 | running |
   +-------+-----------------------------------------+-------------------+---------+
   ```
3. Locate the `ID` of the addon for which you want to delete a user
4. Remove the user with the following command:
   ```bash
   scalingo --app my-app --addon <addon_id> database-users-delete <username>
   ```

## Using Multiple Databases

Each Scalingo for MySQL® addon comes with a default database. You can, however,
create multiple databases on the same Scalingo for MySQL® instance. In this
case:
- The memory and disk storage allocated in the plan are shared between all
  databases
- By default, the database users (the default one and the ones you could have
  created) are shared between databases, even for existing ones
- All databases are [backed up]({% post_url databases/mysql/2000-01-01-backing-up %})
  in the same backup file
- The platform doesn't provide any environment variable for this new database.
  You should, however, be able to generate one from the original
  `SCALINGO_MYSQL_URL`.
