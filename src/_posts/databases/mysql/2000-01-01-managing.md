## Scaling (Changing Plan)

You can change your database plan whenever you want. This operation happens
instantly, no manual input is required. When you change the plan, the instances
of your database are stopped and then restarted with the characteristics of the
chosen plan. According to the type of plan you are originally using, the impact
on your application differs:
- **Starter Plans**: Since these plans are not highly available, expect some
  unavailability during which the scale operations are conducted. The duration
  highly depends on the database size (from seconds to several hours).
- **Business Plans**: Thanks to high availability, only a failover occurs
  during the operation. Current connections are stopped and the application has
  to reconnect. It can be transparent or lead to a ~2-5 seconds interruption,
  depending on the driver used by your application and its configuration.

{% note %}
  Business Plans are only available starting with MySQL® 8.\
  Consider [upgrading to MySQL® 8](#upgrading-to-mysql-8) if you want to
  benefit from high availability with MySQL®.
{% endnote %}

In both cases, once the operation is finished, the application is restarted to
ensure it creates new healthy connections to the database.

{% warning %}
While upscaling (changing for a more powerful plan) is rather safe, you should
take extra care when downscaling: please make sure the new plan can handle all
your data and fits your application workload.
{% endwarning %}

### Using the Dashboard

1. From your web browser, open your [dashboard](https://dashboard.scalingo.com/apps)
2. Click on the application for which you want to scale the Scalingo for
   MySQL® addon
3. Click on the **Resources** tab
4. Locate the **Addons** block and click on the **"&#8230;"** button
5. From the dropdown menu, select **Change plan**
6. Select the new plan
7. Click the **Finish** button
8. Validate by clicking the **Confirm plan change** button

### Using the Database Dashboard

1. From your web browser, [open your database dashboard]({% post_url databases/mysql/2000-01-01-getting-started %}#accessing-the-scalingo-for-mysql-dashboard)
2. Click the **Settings** tab
3. In **General**, select **Change plan**
4. Select the new plan
5. Click the **Finish** button
6. Validate by clicking the **Confirm plan change** button

### Using the Command Line

1. Make sure you have correctly [setup the Scalingo command line tool]({% post_url platform/cli/2000-01-01-start %})
2. From the command line, list the plans available for `mysql`:
   ```bash
   scalingo addons-plans mysql
   ```
   The output should look like this:
   ```text
   +-----------------------+---------------+
   |          ID           |     NAME      |
   +-----------------------+---------------+
   | mysql-sandbox         | Sandbox       |
   | mysql-starter-512     | Starter 512M  |
   | mysql-starter-1024    | Starter 1G    |
   ...
   ```
3. Locate the `ID` corresponding to the plan you want to scale to (for example
   `mysql-business-1024`)
4. List the addons attached to your application:
   ```bash
   scalingo --app my-app addons
   ```
   The output should look like this:
   ```text
   +-------+-----------------------------------------+-------------------+---------+
   | ADDON |                   ID                    |       PLAN        | STATUS  |
   +-------+-----------------------------------------+-------------------+---------+
   | MySQL | ad-871546ad-943a-4929-9770-ec7c839d65f5 | mysql-starter-512 | running |
   ...
   ```
5. Locate the `ID` corresponding to the addon you want to scale
6. Change plan using the `addons-upgrade` sub-command:
   ```bash
   scalingo --app my-app addons-upgrade <addon_ID> <plan_ID>
   ```
   The output should look like this:
   ```text
   -----> Addon ad-d0aa540a-5ed2-41f8-8bbe-91e3aff6623b has been upgraded
          Message from addon provider: Database plan is being changed
   ```

### Using the Terraform Provider

1. Update the `plan` property of the corresponding Resource block in your
   Terraform file to scale the addon:
   ```tf
   resource "scalingo_addon" "my-db" {
     provider_id = "mysql"
     plan = "mysql-business-1024"
     app = "${scalingo_app.my-app.id}"
   }
   ```
   In this example, we switch the `my-db` resource attached to the `my-app`
   application to a MySQL® Business 1024 addon.
2. Run `terraform plan` and check if the result looks good
3. If so, run `terraform apply`


## Upgrading

Upgrading your MySQL® addon consists in changing the database version for
a newer one.

When the database vendor releases a new version of your database engine, we
take some time to study it and test it thoroughly before making it available.
Upgrading to this new version is still your choice. We don't do it
automatically.

{% warning %}
Beware that no downgrade is possible once your database has been upgraded.
{% endwarning %}

Your database needs to be upgraded to the latest minor version before having
access to the next major version. For instance, let's imagine that your version
is `2.3.x` and you want to upgrade to `3.1.x`. If there is a `2.5.x` version
available, you first need to upgrade your database to the `2.5.x` version
before upgrading to the `3.1.x` version.

During the upgrade, a downtime can unfortunately happen, depending on the Plan
you are using and the upgrade:
- **Starter Plans**: In all cases, we have to stop the node to upgrade it,
  causing an inevitable downtime.
- **Business Plans**: We are able to achieve zero-downtime upgrade of
  minor version. In the case of major version upgrade, we need to completely
  stop the nodes, hence causing an inevitable downtime.

In both cases, once the operation is finished, the application is restarted.

{% note %}
There are a couple more prerequisites when upgrading from MySQL® 5.7 to 8.0.
Please make sure to check [these mandatory prerequisites]({% post_url databases/mysql/2000-01-01-mysql-8-prerequisites %}).\
Upgrading to MySQL® 8.0 is mandatory to benefit from MySQL® high availability via
Business Plans.
{% endnote %}

### Using the Database Dashboard

1. From your web browser, [open your database dashboard]({% post_url databases/mysql/2000-01-01-getting-started %}#accessing-the-scalingo-for-mysql-dashboard)
2. Select the **Settings** tab
3. In the **Settings** submenu, select the **General** tab
4. Locate the **Database Version** block
5. If an upgrade is available, a button allows you to trigger the upgrade
6. Click the button to launch the upgrade process

{% note %}
Upgrading a MySQL® addon to a newer version is only available through the
database dashboard.
{% endnote %}


## Managing Users

By default, Scalingo creates a user with read and write permissions on your
database with the following queries:

```sql
GRANT ALL PRIVILEGES ON <username>.* TO '<username>'@'%'
```

{% note %}
It is not possible to delete a protected user or change their password.
{% endnote %}

### Listing Users

#### Using the Database Dashboard

1. From your web browser, [open your database dashboard]({% post_url databases/mysql/2000-01-01-getting-started %}#accessing-the-scalingo-for-mysql-dashboard)
2. Click the **Settings** tab
3. In the **Settings** submenu, select **Users**
4. The list of available users is displayed in the **User Management** block

#### Using the Command Line

1. Make sure you have correctly [setup the Scalingo command line tool]({% post_url platform/cli/2000-01-01-start %})
2. From the command line, run the following command to list the users:
   ```bash
   scalingo --app my-app --addon mysql database-users-list
   ```
   The output should look like this:
   ```text
   +----------------+-----------+-----------+
   |    USERNAME    | READ-ONLY | PROTECTED |
   +----------------+-----------+-----------+
   | my_app_4553    | false     | true      |
   | my_app_4553_rw | false     | false     |
   | my_app_4553_ro | true      | false     |
   +----------------+-----------+-----------+
   ```
   In this example, we can see that the database has 3 users available. One has
   been created along with the addon and is protected, which means it can't be
   removed. Among the two others, one can only read data from the database.

### Creating a New User

The following restrictions apply when creating a new user, regardless of the
method you use:

- Username:
  - Must be between 6 and 16 characters long
  - Can only contain alphanumerical characters and underscores (`_`)
  - Must start with a letter
- Password:
  - Must be between 24 and 64 characters long.
  - Must not contain the character `"` or `'`

#### Using the Database Dashboard

{% note %}
If you want to define a user password, this can only be done via the command line.
{% endnote %}

1. From your web browser, [open your database dashboard]({% post_url databases/mysql/2000-01-01-getting-started %}#accessing-the-scalingo-for-mysql-dashboard)
2. Click the **Settings** tab
3. In the **Settings** submenu, select **Users**
4. Fill the **Add a user** form:
   - Fill a username
   - To grant write abilities to this user, make sure to check the **Write (optional)** checkbox
5. Validate by clicking the **Add this user** button

{% note %}
A secure password is generated automatically and shown in a popup window after the user creation.
You will be able to view and copy it only once.
{% endnote %}

#### Using the Command Line

1. Make sure you have correctly [setup the Scalingo command line tool]({% post_url platform/cli/2000-01-01-start %})
2. From the command line, run the following command to create a new user:
   ```bash
   scalingo --app my-app --addon mysql database-users-create <username>
   ```
   Optionally, if you want to restrict this user to read only abilities, use
   the `--read-only` flag:
   ```bash
   scalingo --app my-app --addon mysql database-users-create --read-only <username>
   ```
3. Set the user password:
   - Either chose a password and confirm it
   - Or let the platform generate a password by leaving the field empty

   The output should look like this:
   - If you set a password:
   ```text
   User "my_user" created.
   ```
   - If you let the platform generate a password:
   ```text
   User "my_user" created with password "YANs3y07m5_KJC2MSDGebh8tx1lliFWh2Yb239zVqGQvbElWDjIN7QWspVH92Ul8".
   ```

### Updating a User Password

   ```
3. An interactive prompt asks you for a password you want to attribute to your user:
   - Either choose a password and confirm it
   - Or let the platform generate a password by leaving the field empty
   The output should look like this:
   - If you set a password:
   ```text
   User "my_user" created.
   ```
   - If you let the platform generate a password:
   ```text
   User "my_user" created with password "YANs3y07m5_KJC2MSDGebh8tx1lliFWh2Yb239zVqGQvbElWDjIN7QWspVH92Ul8".
   ```

   ```

## Using Multiple Databases

Each Scalingo for MySQL® addon comes with a default database. You can, however,
create multiple databases on the same Scalingo for MySQL® instance. In this
case:
- The memory and disk storage allocated in the plan are shared between all
  databases
- By default, the database users (the default one and the ones you could have
  created) are shared between databases, even for existing ones
- All databases are [backed up]({% post_url databases/mysql/2000-01-01-backing-up %})
  in the same backup file
- The platform doesn't provide any environment variable for this new database.
  You should, however, be able to generate one from the original
  `SCALINGO_MYSQL_URL`.

### Listing Existing Databases

#### Using the Database Dashboard

1. From your web browser, [open your database dashboard]({% post_url databases/mysql/2000-01-01-getting-started %}#accessing-the-scalingo-for-mysql-dashboard)

## Working with SQL Modes

SQL modes allow you to configure MySQL® to behave according to specific
standards, adjusting how it processes queries and verifies data validity. This
includes settings that can make MySQL® more strict or more flexible regarding
SQL syntax and data constraints, providing developers the ability to optimize
database performances based on their application's requirements.

Scalingo doesn't moderate the modes available, which means all modes supported
by your addon are indeed available. The exhaustive list may vary depending on
your MySQL® version. Descriptions of the modes can be found in the official
MySQL® documentation:

- [for MySQL® `5.7` `EOL`](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/5.7/en/sql-mode.html)
- [for MySQL® `8.0`](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.0/en/sql-mode.html)

Currently, the default SQL mode includes: `ONLY_FULL_GROUP_BY`,
`STRICT_TRANS_TABLES`, `NO_ZERO_IN_DATE`, `NO_ZERO_DATE`,
`ERROR_FOR_DIVISION_BY_ZERO`, and `NO_ENGINE_SUBSTITUTION`.

### Setting SQL Modes

#### Using the Database Dashboard

1. From your web browser, open your [database dashboard]({% post_url databases/mysql/2000-01-01-getting-started %}#accessing-the-mysql-dashboard)
2. Click the **Settings** tab
3. In the **Settings** submenu, select **Configuration**
4. Click the **Manage SQL modes** button
5. Select the mode(s) you are interested in
6. Validate by clicking the **Update configuration** button
7. The changes are done at runtime, which means they immediately apply to new
   queries

{% note %}
Setting SQL modes is only available through the database dashboard. MySQL®
users provided by the platform do not have the necessary permissions to perform
these actions via the MySQL® console.
{% endnote %}
