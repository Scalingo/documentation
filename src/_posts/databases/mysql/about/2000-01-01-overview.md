## MySQL®

MySQL® is a free and open-source relational database management system. It is
known for its reliability, ease of use, and performance, making it one of the
most popular database systems in the world. It is well-suited for a wide range
of applications, from small-scale websites to large-scale enterprise solutions.


## Scalingo for MySQL®

Scalingo for MySQL® (Community Edition) is our official MySQL® addon. [We have
several plans available][available-plans] from which you can choose depending
on your needs and budget. As always, a free plan is available for you to test
our offer.

Please make sure to also see [**Features**][mysql-features] and
[**Limitations**][mysql-limitations] to get a comprehensive view of what is
included in our offers.

### Life-Cycle

At Scalingo, we focus on providing stable and well-supported MySQL® versions
for production workloads. That's why we chose to focus on the **LTS** releases
of MySQL®, which are shipped every 2 years.

Our managed service currently includes version 8.0.x, with plans to introduce
version 8.4 (LTS) in a near future.

When we release a new LTS version, we also progressively stop supporting the
previous one, encouraging our customers to migrate towards the latest one.

Once the oldest LTS version has reached its End Of Life, we **may** enforce the
upgrade to the newest LTS version.

Each major version we provide benefits from minor upgrades including critical
bug fixes and security patches. New features are only added with new major
versions.

#### Available Version

| MySQL Version  | Full Version      |
| -------------: | ----------------: |
| **`8.4`**      | up to `8.4.8-3`   |
| **`8.0`**      | up to `8.0.45-1`  |

The latest version of MySQL® available is **`8.4.8-3`**.

The default version is still MySQL **`8.0.45-1`** when attaching a MySQL® addon to your
application.
