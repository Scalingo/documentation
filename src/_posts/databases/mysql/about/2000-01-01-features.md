In addition to the [features common to every database
addon][databases-features], Scalingo includes several features that are
specific to our Scalingo for MySQL® offers.

The following table lists these features, with distinguishing values for each
class of service. A short description of each feature is also available after
the table.

| Feature                                            | Sandbox | Starter        | Business       |
| -------------------------------------------------- | :-----: | :------------: | :------------: |
| RAM                                                | 512 MB  | 512 MB - 32 GB | 1 GB - 32 GB   |
| Included Storage                                   | 512 MB  | 10 GB - 640 GB | 20 GB - 640 GB |
| Maximum number of connections                      | 13      | 30 - 1536      | 64 - 1536      |
| Nodes ([High Availability](#high-availability))    | 1       | 1              | 3              |
| Gateways ([High Availability](#high-availability)) | 1       | 1              | 2              |

### High Availability

**Sandbox** and **Starter plans** are running on a single node, without any
redundancy or high availability mechanism. Consequently, we don't consider them
to be *highly available*. This translates into a lower [Service Level
Agreement][databases-sla].

**Business plans**, on their side, include a fully-managed InnoDB cluster made
of:

- Three (3) MySQL® nodes implementing MySQL® Group Replication in
  single-primary mode (one primary, two secondaries *hot-standby*).

- Two (2) MySQL® Router instances (one leader and one failover) as entrypoint
  to your cluster private network.

- Encrypted communications between all instances of the cluster.

The following schema describes the cluster we setup and maintain for each
Business plan:

{% include mdl_img.html %}

Choosing such a plan drastically lowers the risk of unavailability, be it
during a maintenance operation (database upgrade, for example) or because of a
platform issue.
