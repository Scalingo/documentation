Starter and Business plans of Scalingo for MySQL速 include automated and
managed backups so you don't have to worry about them.

We use [Periodic](#understanding-periodic-backups) backups to create the
automated ones. [Manual backups](#understanding-manual-backups) are also
available for these plans.


## Understanding Periodic Backups

Periodic backups are done on a daily basis. They consist in dumping your
database in an archive that we keep during a certain amount of time.

For Business plans, the backup is done on the secondary node to avoid any
impact on your primary node.

### Retention Policy for Periodic Backups

We keep a limited amount of backups depending on your database plan:
- A daily backup is retained for the last 7 days, which means that we will keep
  a maximum of 7 daily backups (one for each of the last 7 days).
- A weekly backup means that only one backup is saved over a 7 days period.
- A monthly backup means that only one backup is saved over the course of a
  month.

| Plan     | Weekly Backups Retained | Monthly Backups Retained |
| -------- + ----------------------- + ------------------------ |
| Sandbox  | N/A                     | N/A                      |
| Starter  | 4 weeks                 | 0 month                  |
| Business | 8 weeks                 | 12 months                |

### Configuring Periodic Backups

By default, Periodic backups are done around 1:00 AM Central European Time
(CET or UTC+0100). This time can be modified.

{% note %}
The scheduled time is not strongly enforced: it might get delayed depending on
the workload on our infrastructure.
{% endnote %}

#### Using the Database Dashboard

1. From your web browser, open your [database dashboard]({% post_url databases/mysql/2000-01-01-getting-started %}#accessing-the-scalingo-for-mysql-dashboard)
2. Click the **Backups** tab
3. Locate the **Backup schedule** block
4. Click the **Schedule** button
5. Make sure to check the **I want to enable scheduled backups** checkbox
6. Pick an hour (**timezone is UTC**)
7. Validate by clicking the **Update** button

#### Using the Command Line

1. Make sure you have correctly [setup the Scalingo command line tool]({% post_url platform/cli/2000-01-01-start %})
2. Configure the time of backup:
   - By setting an hour:
     ```bash
     scalingo --app my-app --addon mysql backups-config --schedule-at 3
     ```
     In this example, we ask the platform to create the backups at ~03:00.

     _Note: The timezone used is the local timezone of the machine running the command._
   - By setting an hour and a timezone:
     ```bash
     scalingo --app my-app --addon mysql backups-config --schedule-at "4:00 UTC"
     ```
     In this example, we ask the platform to create the backup at ~04:00 UTC.

   The output should look like this:
   ```text
   -----> Periodic backups will be done daily at 6:00 CET
   ```

### Downloading a Periodic Backup

#### Using the Database Dashboard

1. From your web browser, open your [database dashboard]({% post_url databases/mysql/2000-01-01-getting-started %}#accessing-the-scalingo-for-mysql-dashboard)
2. Click the **Backups** tab
3. Locate the **Backups** block
4. Locate the Periodic backup you are interested in
5. Click the corresponding **Download** button

#### Using the Command Line

1. Make sure you have correctly [setup the Scalingo command line tool]({% post_url platform/cli/2000-01-01-start %})
2. Run the following command(s):
   - To download the latest backup available:
     ```bash
     scalingo --app my-app --addon mysql backups-download
     ```
     The output should look like this:
     ```text
     -----> Selected the most recent successful backup
     139.37 KiB / 139.37 KiB [----------------------------------] 100.00% ? p/s
     ===> 20231207000608_my_app_4553.tar.gz
     ```
     The backup is downloaded in your current working directory.
   - To download a specific backup:
     1. List the backups available for this database addon:
        ```bash
        scalingo --app my-app --addon mysql backups
        ```
        The output should look like this:
        ```text
        +--------------------------+--------------------------------+--------+--------+
        |            ID            |           CREATED AT           |  SIZE  | STATUS |
        +--------------------------+--------------------------------+--------+--------+
        | 65710b0a99c3cd23d455edee | Thu, 07 Dec 2023 01:00:10 CET  | 143 kB | done   |
        | 656fb98b99c3cd23d455d4e7 | Wed, 06 Dec 2023 01:00:11 CET  | 143 kB | done   |
        | 656e680a99c3cd23d455c1f0 | Tue, 05 Dec 2023 01:00:10 CET  | 143 kB | done   |
        ...
        ```
     2. Locate the `ID` of the backup you want to download
     3. Download the backup:
        ```bash
        scalingo --app my-app --addon mysql backups-download --backup <backup_ID>
        ```
        The output should look like this:
        ```text
        79.10 KiB / 79.10 KiB [---------------------------------] 100.00% ? p/s
        ===> 20230305000044_my_app_4553.tar.gz
        ```
        The backup is downloaded in your current working directory.


## Understanding Manual Backups

Manual backups use the exact same mechanism as Periodic backups, except that
they are not automated. As the name suggests, Manual backups are triggered
manually, whenever you want.

### Retention Policy for Manual Backups

We keep a limited amount of Manual backups depending on your database plan:

<div class="overflow-horizontal-content" markdown="1">
| Plan         | Backups Retained |
| ------------ + ---------------- |
| Sandbox      | N/A              |
| Starter      | 10               |
| Business     | 50               |
{: .table }
</div>

When a database is removed from an application, the retention policy remains
untouched: backups are **not** instantly deleted.

### Creating a Manual Backup

#### Using the Database Dashboard

1. From your web browser, open your [database dashboard]({% post_url databases/mysql/2000-01-01-getting-started %}#accessing-the-scalingo-for-mysql-dashboard)
2. Click the **Backups** tab
3. Locate the **Backups** block
4. Click the **Trigger manual backup** button

#### Using the Command Line

1. Make sure you have correctly [setup the Scalingo command line tool]({% post_url platform/cli/2000-01-01-start %})
2. Ask the platform to backup the database:
   ```bash
   scalingo --app my-app --addon mysql backups-create
   ```
   After a while, the output should look like this:
   ```text
   -----> Backup successfully finished
   ```

### Downloading a Manual Backup

Please refer to [Downloading a Periodic Backup](#downloading-a-periodic-backup)
section, as the process is exactly the same.


## Dumping the Database

There are different ways to dump (and restore) a MySQL速 database. We
generally advise to either:
- Process from a [one-off container](#from-a-one-off-container)
- Or conduct the operations [from your workstation](#from-your-workstation), by
  accessing the database in a secured manner

### From a One-Off Container

This method doesn't require to make your database reachable over Internet.

1. Follow the procedure to [access your MySQL速 database from a one-off
   container]({% post_url databases/mysql/2000-01-01-accessing %}#using-a-one-off)
2. Make sure to [understand the connection URI]({% post_url databases/mysql/2000-01-01-connecting %}#understanding-the-connection-uri)
3. Dump the database:
   ```bash
   mysqldump --user=<user> --password=<password> --host=<host> --port=<port> --column-statistics=0 --no-tablespaces <dbname> > dump.sql
   ```
   With `user`, `password`, `host`, `port` and `dbname` from your original
   [connection URI]({% post_url databases/mysql/2000-01-01-connecting %}#understanding-the-connection-uri).

{% note %}
The dump is lost as soon as you exit the one-off container. Consequently, you
have to do something with it in the one-off (for example, you could upload it
somewhere).
{% endnote %}

### From Your Workstation

1. [Open a DB tunnel]({% post_url databases/mysql/2000-01-01-accessing %}#using-our-command-line-tool)
   so you can access your database from your workstation
2. Make sure to [understand the connection URI]({% post_url databases/mysql/2000-01-01-connecting %}#understanding-the-connection-uri)
3. Dump the database using the `mysqldump` command (you may have to install it):
   ```bash
   mysqldump --user=<user> --password=<password> --host=127.0.0.1 --port=<port> --column-statistics=0 --no-tablespaces <dbname> > dump.sql
   ```
   With `user`, `password` and `dbname` from your original [connection URI]({% post_url databases/mysql/2000-01-01-connecting %}#understanding-the-connection-uri)
   and `port` depending on what you did (default is `10000`)
