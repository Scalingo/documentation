### Internal controls

We have implemented internal controls to ensure that our security measures are effective. These internal controls include:

- Regular security audits to identify vulnerabilities and to ensure that our security measures are effective.
- Regular security training for our employees to ensure that they are aware of the security measures implemented by the
  platform and to prevent security incidents caused by human error.
- Regular security reviews of our security policies and procedures to ensure that they are up-to-date and effective.
- Regular reviews of our policies and procedures to ensure that they comply with industry best practices and regulatory
  requirements.

### Audits

We conduct regular external security audits to ensure that our platform is secure.

We have both an internal audit program and independent external audit program to ensure that we comply with the norms and standards of the industry and
that our security measures are effective.
