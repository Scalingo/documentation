### Logical Access Control

Access to the platform administration is restricted to authorized personnel only. It is secured by two-factor
authentication and when possible uses a bastion host and a VPN connection.

### Access Review and Revocation

Access to the platform is reviewed regularly to ensure that only authorized personnel have access to the platform.
Access is revoked immediately when an employee leaves the company or when their access is no longer required.
