### Backup Policy

We perform regular backups of the data hosted on the platform to protect it from data loss. The backups are stored in a
secure redundant storage system to ensure that the data is protected from hardware failures and other disasters.

### Recovery Policy

In the event of a data loss, we follow a predefined recovery plan to restore the data from the backups. The recovery
plan includes procedures for identifying the cause of the data loss, restoring the data from the backups, and verifying
the integrity of the restored data.

### Backup Testing

We regularly test our backups to ensure that they are working correctly and that we can restore the data in the event of
a data loss. The backups are tested by restoring the data to a separate environment and verifying that the data is
intact and that the applications are working correctly.
