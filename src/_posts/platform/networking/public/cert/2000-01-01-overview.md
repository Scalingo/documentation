A **TLS certificate** is a digital authentication credential issued by a
trusted authority called **Certificate Authority** (CA). It allows users of a
website to verify the identity of the website and enables encrypted
communication between them and the website.

A TLS certificate contains information such as the website's domain name and
its public key, allowing a web browser (or any client) to confirm that it's
connecting to the legitimate server and establish a secure, private channel.

In essence, this certificate ensures data exchanged over the Internet cannot
be read or altered by unauthorized parties, thanks to cryptography.


## TLS Certificates at Scalingo

At Scalingo, we use a CA named [Let's Encrypt][letsencrypt] to automatically
generate a certificate for every [custom domain][domains-custom] added to the
platform.\\
For further information about this feature, please read [our dedicated
documentation][cert-default].

We also support TLS certificates generated and signed by other Certificate
Authorities, so you can provide your own custom certificate if you prefer.\\
For further information about this feature, please read [our dedicated
documentation][cert-custom].
