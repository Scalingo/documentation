Every application deployed on Scalingo is automatically given a **default
public domain name**, allowing immediate public access to the app. By default,
this domain name also comes with a [TLS certificate][tls-cert].

This default domain name is made of three parts, separated by a dot (`.`):
1. The <code class="domain-name-ap">name of the application</code>.
2. The name of the region where the application is hosted: either
   <code class="domain-name-pn">osc-fr1</code> or
   <code class="domain-name-pn">osc-secnum-fr1</code>.
3. A fixed suffix, common to all applications hosted on Scalingo:
   <code class="domain-name-nid">scalingo.io</code>.

An app called `my-app`, hosted on `osc-fr1` would be reachable using\\
{%pndn my-app.osc-fr1.scalingo.io %}

The same app hosted on `osc-secnum-fr1` would be reachable using\\
{%pndn my-app.osc-secnum-fr1.scalingo.io %}

{% note %}
We strongly recommend adding a [custom domain name][domains-custom] to
production applications.
{% endnote %}


## Default Public Domain Name for Review Apps

[Review apps][review-apps] are also automatically given a default public domain
name to ease their public access. This default domain name is made of the three
same parts, except that the <code class="domain-name-ap">application
name</code> part is suffixed with `-pr<Pull Request number>`.

For instance, a review app deployed based on the pull request #123, openend for
an app called `my-app` hosted on `osc-fr1` would be reachable using\\
{%pndn my-app-pr123.osc-fr1.scalingo.io %}


## Technical Considerations

- Even if it's always available, the default Scalingo domain name only allows
  to route traffic to the `web` [process type][web-process-type].
- Containers don't have their own **public** domain name, so it's not possible
  to target a specific container from the outside world.
