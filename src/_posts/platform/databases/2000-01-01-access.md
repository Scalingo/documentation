This page is a high-level overview of the three maintenance access methods for
Scalingo databases.

For detailed setup, limits, and troubleshooting steps, use the dedicated guide
linked in each section.

* [Remote Console](#interactive-remote-console): run an interactive client in a
  one-off container attached to your app workflow.
* [Encrypted Tunnel](#encrypted-tunnel): open an SSH tunnel from your
  workstation to access the database locally.
* [Direct Access](#direct-access): connect over the network with the database
  connection string.

| Connection option                           | Shared Resources | Dedicated Resources |
|---------------------------------------------|------------------|---------------------|
| Remote Console (from a one-off container)   | Yes              | No                  |
| Encrypted Tunnel (`db-tunnel`)              | Yes              | No                  |
| Direct Access (connection string)           | Yes              | Yes                 |

## Interactive Remote Console

Remote Console is available for supported Shared Resources databases only
(PostgreSQL, MySQL, MongoDB, Redis, InfluxDB). It is not available for
OpenSearch or Dedicated Resources databases.

```bash
# Open a console using the `mysql` client
scalingo --app my-app mysql-console

# Open a console using the `psql` client
scalingo --app my-app pgsql-console

# Open a console using the `redis-cli` client
scalingo --app my-app redis-console
```

Detailed setup, compatibility, and supported tools:
[Remote Database Console][remote-console].


## Encrypted Tunnel

Encrypted Tunnel is available on Shared Resources and exposes the remote
database on `127.0.0.1:<localport>` on your workstation.
Use this method when you need temporary access from your workstation while
keeping the database private.

```bash
scalingo --app my-app db-tunnel SCALINGO_POSTGRESQL_URL
```

For Shared Resources, this is the most secure way to connect from outside
Scalingo because it avoids exposing the database on the public Internet.

Detailed setup, OpenSSH mode, and client usage:
[Encrypted Tunnel Guide][encrypted-tunnel-guide].


## Direct Access

Use the database connection string directly from your client when tunnel or
console workflows are not applicable.
Use this method when a client or service must connect directly to the database
endpoint without maintaining an SSH tunnel.

On **Shared Resources**, direct connection from outside Scalingo requires:

1. Enabling **Force TLS**.
2. Enabling **Internet Accessibility**.

On **Dedicated Resources**, direct connection is the standard remote access
method and is controlled by firewall allowlists (deny by default).

For network exposure rules, see [Database Network Exposure][database-exposure].


## Access the same database from multiple applications

To share a database across multiple applications, add the database connection 
string as an environment variable in each application that needs access.

In the application where the database add-on is attached, the connection string 
is available as an environment variable (for PostgreSQL, typically 
`SCALINGO_POSTGRESQL_URL`). This value includes the host and credentials, so 
treat it as a secret

Copy the value, then create an environment variable in the other application and paste it there. Restart the application to apply the change.
