This page explains how to connect to a database for maintenance operations
(inspection, import/export, manual queries):

* [Remote Console](#interactive-remote-console): open an interactive database console from Scalingo app 
  workflows for quick maintenance tasks.
* [Encrypted Tunnel](#encrypted-tunnel): create an SSH tunnel to access the database from your 
  workstation as if it were local (recommended for full client usage, including 
  import/export operations).
* [Direct Access](#direct-access): connect directly using the database connection string over the 
  network.

| Connection option                           | Shared Resources | Dedicated Resources |
|---------------------------------------------|------------------|---------------------|
| Remote Console (from a one-off container)   | Yes              | No                  |
| Encrypted Tunnel (`db-tunnel`)              | Yes              | No                  |
| Direct Access (connection string)           | Yes              | Yes                 |

{% note %}
This page focuses on connection workflows.

{% endnote %}


## Interactive Remote Console

The following commands let you open a console for supported Shared Resources
databases only. This feature is available for the database engines listed below
(PostgreSQL, MySQL, MongoDB, Redis, InfluxDB), and is not available for
OpenSearch or Dedicated Resources databases.

{% note %}
These tools run in a one-off container, which is a copy of your app execution
environment. Client versions follow stack compatibility constraints, so some
versions are not available on older stacks (for example, MySQL client 8.4 is
not available on `scalingo-20`).
{% endnote %}

```bash
# Open a console using the `mysql` client
scalingo --app my-app mysql-console

# Open a console using the `psql` client
scalingo --app my-app pgsql-console

# Open a console using the `mongo` client
scalingo --app my-app mongo-console

# Open a console using the `redis-cli` client
scalingo --app my-app redis-console

# Open a console using the `InfluxDB shell` client
scalingo --app my-app influxdb-console
```

Make sure you have already added the corresponding addon from your application
dashboard before running one of these commands.

### Manually install the databases CLI in one-off

If you started a Bash process in a [one-off container]({% post_url platform/app/2000-01-01-tasks%}),
you can download various CLI tools for the supported databases listed below:

| Database   | Keyword                       | Installed Tools      |
| ---------- | ----------------------------- | -------------------- |
| PostgreSQL | `pgsql`, `postgresql`, `psql` | `psql`, `pg_basebackup`, `pg_controldata`, `pg_dump`, `pg_isready`, `pg_recvlogical`, `pg_restore`, `pg_test_fsync`, `pg_upgrade`, `pg_archivecleanup`, `pg_config`, `pg_ctl`, `pg_dumpall`, `pg_receivewal`, `pg_resetwal`, `pg_rewind`, `pg_test_timing`, `pg_waldump` |
| MySQL      | `mysql`                       | `mysql`, `mysqldump` |
| MongoDB    | `mongo`                       | `mongo`, `mongodump`, `mongorestore`, `mongoexport`, `mongoimport` |
| Redis      | `redis`                       | `redis-cli`          |
| InfluxDB   | `influxdb`, `influx`          | `influx`             |

{% include dbclient_fetcher.md %}

{% warning %}
The `redis-cli` can NOT be used if Force TLS is enabled on the Scalingo for Caching database. It results in an error message `I/O error`.
{% endwarning %}

## Connect a Database

Use one of the following methods depending on your architecture model and
security constraints.

### Encrypted Tunnel

The DB tunnel encrypts traffic between your computer and Scalingo, so data is 
not sent in clear text over the network. It does not add an extra access-control 
layer: we only check that your public key is registered on the platform.

{% include info_command_line_tool.md %}

{% include db_tunnel_requires_ssh.md %}

#### Build the Tunnel

By running the following command, an encrypted SSH tunnel will be built between you and your database.

```bash
$ scalingo --app my-app db-tunnel MONGO_URL
Building tunnel to <dbhost>:<dbport>
You can access your database on '127.0.0.1:<localport>'
```
We use `MONGO_URL` in the example, but you can use any database environment
variable (for example `REDIS_URL` or `DATABASE_URL`) according to the database
you are using.

{% include mongo_db_tunnel.md %}

#### Use any client to read, import or export your data

Once the tunnel has been built, you can use any tool you need by connecting it to the
`127.0.0.1:<localport>` host.

{% note %}
  Credentials to connect to the database are still the same, so read them from `scalingo --app my-app env`
{% endnote %}

#### Example

```bash
$ scalingo --app my-app db-tunnel MONGO_URL
Building tunnel to <dbhost>:<dbport>
You can access your database on '127.0.0.1:10000'

# In another terminal
$ scalingo --app my-app env | grep MONGO_URL
MONGO_URL=mongo://user:secret@<dbhost>:<dbport>/database?options

$ mongo "mongo://user:secret@<dbhost>:<dbport>/database?options"
$ mongodump -u user -p secret -h localhost:10000 -d database
```

If you are connecting to the database using SSL/TLS, you should add both options `--ssl` and
`--sslAllowInvalidCertificates` to the `mongo` command.

#### Build the tunnel with the OpenSSH client

Our command line tool handles it in a single command, but you might want to use
the tunnel without it. With the standard OpenSSH client, the way to build the
tunnel is:

```bash
ssh -L <local port>:<database host>:<database port> git@<SSH hostname> -p <SSH port> -N
```

The SSH hostname and port depend on the region of your application:

{% include ssh_endpoints.md %}

The database host and database port can be found in the environment variable
representing the connection string of your database instance. Get it from the
dashboard or with the `env` command of the CLI. It should look like:

* `SCALINGO_<TYPE>_URL`

{% warning %}
Since this value may change, use the variable directly in your application rather than hard-coding or duplicating it in your code.
{% endwarning %}

The value of this variable is an URL which represents:

```
scheme://user:password@host:port/database_name
```

As stated previously, you need to get the `host` and `port` from the URL.

Example:

If the app is in the region `osc-fr1` and if the environment variable is the following:

```
SCALINGO_POSTGRESQL_URL=postgresql://user:secret@my-db.postgresql.a.osc-fr1.scalingo-dbs.com:30000/my-db
```

The command to run is:

```bash
ssh -L 10000:my-db.postgresql.a.osc-fr1.scalingo-dbs.com:30000 git@ssh.osc-fr1.scalingo.com -N
```

Then you connect on `localhost:10000` to reach your Scalingo database. (You'll still need to authenticate to the
database with the credential you can get from the connection string)

### Direct Access

Use the database connection string directly from your client when tunnel or
console workflows are not applicable.

{% warning %}
Enable Internet Accessibility only for specific use cases, and only if you understand the security implications. It exposes your database to the public Internet.
{% endwarning %}

On **Shared Resources**, direct connection from outside Scalingo requires:

1. Enabling **Force TLS**.
2. Enabling **Internet Accessibility**.

On **Dedicated Resources**, direct connection is the standard remote access
method and is controlled by firewall allowlists (deny by default).

For network-level prerequisites and security model details, see
[Database Network Exposure][database-exposure].


## Access the Same Database From Multiple Applications

To share a database across multiple applications, add the database connection string as an environment variable in each application that needs access.

In the application where the database add-on is attached, the connection string is available as an environment variable (for PostgreSQL, typically SCALINGO_POSTGRESQL_URL). This value includes the host and credentials, so treat it as a secret

Copy the value, then create an environment variable in the other application and paste it there. Restart the application to apply the change.
