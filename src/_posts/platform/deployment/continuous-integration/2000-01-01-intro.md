## Introduction

A good practice in software development is known as Continuous Integration (CI).
This practice consists of merging all developers work at regular interval to a
common repository. Most of the time this practice is associated with automatic
execution of unit tests and Continuous Deployment (CD). The CD approach consists
of delivering new software releases as often as possible through automated
deployments.

With its intrinsic automated nature, Scalingo is a perfect fit to handle CI/CD
for your projects.

Scalingo integrates with most CI platforms. We wrote a guide for the most
well-known:

- [Bitbucket]({% post_url platform/deployment/continuous-integration/2000-01-01-deploy-scalingo-from-bitbucket %})
- [CircleCI]({% post_url platform/deployment/continuous-integration/2000-01-01-deploy-scalingo-from-circle-ci %})
- [Codeship]({% post_url platform/deployment/continuous-integration/2000-01-01-deploy-scalingo-from-codeship %})
- [GitLab CI/CD]({% post_url platform/deployment/continuous-integration/2000-01-01-deploy-scalingo-from-gitlab %})
- [SemaphoreCI]({% post_url platform/deployment/continuous-integration/2000-01-01-deploy-scalingo-from-semaphore-ci %})
- [Travis CI]({% post_url platform/deployment/continuous-integration/2000-01-01-deploy-scalingo-from-travis-ci %})
