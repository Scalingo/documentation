If you need to deploy a technology which is not supported by Scalingo,
you can use an open-source buildpack or a buildpack you have developed.

To achieve this, you must define the following environment variable in
the environment of the concerned application: `BUILDPACK_URL`.

Example:

```text
BUILDPACK_URL=https://github.com/cloudfoundry/java-buildpack
```

Then the deployment logs contain:

```text
<-- Start deployment of my-app -->
-----> Cloning custom buildpack: 'https://github.com/cloudfoundry/java-buildpack'

-- SNIP --
```

If you need to test a branch of a custom buildpack different than `master`, specify its name at the
end of the URL:

```text
BUILDPACK_URL=https://github.com/cloudfoundry/java-buildpack#branch_name
```

## Build a Custom Buildpack

Our execution stack is public and can be found as a docker image on the __Docker
Hub__. Its name is
[scalingo/scalingo-22](https://hub.docker.com/r/scalingo/scalingo-22). The base
image is based on Ubuntu 22.04. The Scalingo stack contains every tool from the
`ubuntu:22.04` Docker image.

Run the following command to start a container in the same environment a custom
buildpack will be executed:

```bash
docker run --pull always --rm --interactive --tty -e STACK=scalingo-22 -v /path/to/custom-buildpack:/buildpack -v /path/to/application:/build scalingo/scalingo-22:latest bash
```

Then, export the environment variables from your application into the Docker container, and create the folders that will be used by the buildpack scripts:

```bash
mkdir /tmp/{cache,env}
```

If you need to build third-party binaries, you are assured that they will work on the Scalingo platform.

### Architecture of a Buildpack

A buildpack has three mandatory entrypoints:

- `bin/detect`: exit with success (return code is 0) if the buildpack applies to
  the current application.
- `bin/compile`: installs the technology.
- `bin/release`: handles some metadata.

All these entrypoints are usually Bash script.

#### Script `detect`

The purpose of the script located in `bin/detect` is to detect if the buildpack
applies to the application. It takes the build directory in argument. If the
buildpack is applicable, the script must print on the standard output the name
of the technology and return with the code 0.

Here is an example of such script which detects a buildpack as applicable for
our technology if the file `biniou.yml` is present at the root of the
application.

```bash
#!/bin/bash

BUILD_DIR=${1:-}

if [ -f "${BUILD_DIR}/biniou.yml" ]; then
  echo "My Wonderful Technology" && exit 0
fi

echo "no" && exit 1
```

#### Script `compile`

The purpose of the script located in `bin/compile` is to actually compile the
application. It is called with three arguments:

- The build directory: contains the code of the application.
- The cache directory: used to store information one wants to keep between two
  builds.
- The environment directory: contains a file per environment variable defined.
  For instance, an environment variable `TEST=1234` leads to a file named `TEST`
  containing `1234`.

Here is an example of a (very basic) compile script to compile a C application:

```bash
#!/bin/bash

BUILD_DIR=${1:-}
CACHE_DIR=${2:-}
ENV_DIR=${3:-}

echo "-----> Install gcc"
apt-get install --yes gcc

echo "-----> Compile the client application"
gcc -o my-app .
```

You can test this script in the Docker container with the command:

```bash
/buildpack/bin/compile /build /tmp/cache /tmp/env
```

#### Script `release`

The purpose of the script located in `bin/release` is to generate some metadata
about the application. It takes the build directory in argument. It must print
on the standard output a YAML file with a couple of keys:

- `addons`: list of addons to install. It is only applied the first time an
  application is deployed.
- `config_vars`: hash of default environment variables.
- `default_process_types`: hash of default Procfile entries.

Here is an example of such script for a Node.js application:

```bash
#!/bin/bash

cat << EOF
---
addons:
  - scalingo-postgresql
config_vars:
  PATH: /app/bin:/app/vendor/nginx/sbin:/app/vendor/php/bin:/app/vendor/php/sbin:/usr/local/bin:/usr/bin:/bin
default_process_types:
  web: npm start
EOF
```

#### Script `.profile.d`

During startup of any container types, the container starts a Bash shell that sources all the files in the `.profile.d/` folder, before executing the container start command. This allows a buildpack to customize the environment of the application. You can take inspiration of what has been done in Scalingo [PHP buildpack](https://github.com/Scalingo/php-buildpack/blob/dc87b69c170bb94658ffbb03c6cbbaa34b28f775/bin/compile#L275-L286) with this folder.

{% note %}
Script in the `.profile.d/` folder should only be written by buildpacks. If you need to perform an initialization task specific to your application, at the time your container boots, you should use a`.profile` script. Those are guaranteed to be executed after the scripts in `.profile.d/`.
{% endnote %}

Feel free to take inspiration from the various buildpacks proposed by Scalingo:
[https://github.com/Scalingo?utf8=%E2%9C%93&q=buildpack&type=&language=](https://github.com/Scalingo?utf8=%E2%9C%93&q=buildpack&type=&language=).

### Private buildpack

If the url of `BUILDPACK_URL` is ending with `.tar.gz` or `.tgz` we will download and extract this archive. This allows you to host a private buildpack archive with typically a secret hash inside the url (for ex. https://myhostingsite/secret-hash-with-lot-letters-and-numbers.tgz).
