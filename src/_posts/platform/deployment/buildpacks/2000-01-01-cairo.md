## Purpose of this buildpack

{% warning %}
  This buildpack has been deprecated since scalingo-22 in favour of the [APT Buildpack]({% post_url platform/deployment/buildpacks/2000-01-01-apt %})
  All the libraries installable through this buildpack (except libgif) are installed by default in Ubuntu 22.04 and higher.
{% endwarning %}

This is a buildpack that installs [Cairo](https://cairographics.org/) and
its dependencies ([Pango](http://www.pango.org/), [Pixman](https://pixman.org/),
[FreeType](https://www.freetype.org/),
[HarfBuzz](https://harfbuzz.github.io/), and [giflib](https://giflib.sourceforge.net/)) into a container image.

All the libs are installable separately using the `CAIRO_BUILDPACK_LIBS`
environment variable.

When used with
[multi-buildpacks](https://github.com/Scalingo/multi-buildpack),
it enables subsequent buildpacks / steps to any of these libraries.

## Set up this buildpack for your application

This buildpack is designed to be used in conjunction with one or more additional
buildpacks, thanks to the [multi buildpack]({% post_url platform/deployment/buildpacks/2000-01-01-multi %})

When creating a new Scalingo app:

```bash
scalingo create <appname>

cat << EOF > .buildpacks
https://github.com/Scalingo/cairo-buildpack.git
https://github.com/Scalingo/nodejs-buildpack.git
EOF

git push scalingo master
```

When modifying an existing Scalingo app:

```bash
cat << EOF > .buildpacks
https://github.com/Scalingo/cairo-buildpack.git
https://github.com/Scalingo/nodejs-buildpack.git
EOF

git push scalingo master
```

## Configuration

Without any particular configuration, all the libraries will be installed, but you can specify
a particular set of libs to install thanks to the `CAIRO_BUILDPACK_LIBS` environment variable.

Example:

```
CAIRO_BUILDPACK_LIBS=giflib
CAIRO_BUILDPACK_LIBS=giflib,pixman
CAIRO_BUILDPACK_LIBS=pango,freetype
```
