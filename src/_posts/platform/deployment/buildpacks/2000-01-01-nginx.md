Looking for a reverse proxy or an API gateway for your apps? This buildpack
might be the solution you are looking for. You first need to create a new
Scalingo application and configure it to make use of the Nginx buildpack.

## Purpose of This Buildpack

The [Nginx buildpack](https://github.com/Scalingo/nginx-buildpack) lets you
specify custom Nginx configuration. With this buildpack, you can provide a Nginx
configuration file with the rules you want to set.

## Setup This Buildpack

Configure your application to use the Nginx buildpack via the web dashboard or
the Scalingo CLI:

```console
$ scalingo create my-app
$ scalingo env-set BUILDPACK_URL=https://github.com/Scalingo/nginx-buildpack.git
```

## Configuration

The buildpack is expecting a configuration file at the root of the project which can be:

- `nginx.conf`: configuration file
- `nginx.conf.erb`: template to generate the configuration file
- `servers.conf.erb`: (optional) lets you configure your Nginx instance at the
  `http` level if required

If the template is found, it will be rendered as configuration file, it let you use environment
variables as in the following examples.

You can also use the [Nginx playground](https://nginx-playground.wizardzines.com) to help you write and debug your configuration file.

### Specify Nginx Version

By default, we're installing the latest available version of Nginx, but if you want to use a specific
version, you can define the environment variable `NGINX_VERSION`:

```console
$ scalingo env-set NGINX_VERSION=1.14.2
```

{% include nginx_versions.md %}

### Discouraged Directives

The following directives should not be used in you configuration file:
`listen`, `access_log`, `error_log` and `server_name`.

### Configuration Examples

Use Nginx configuration: [nginx.org/en/docs](https://nginx.org/en/docs) to get
details about how to configure your app.

#### Split traffic to 2 APIs

This configuration example lets you split the traffic to two different
Scalingo applications depending on the path:

```nginx
location /api/v1 {
  proxy_pass <%= ENV["API_V1_BACKEND"] %>;
  proxy_redirect default;
}

location /api/v2 {
  proxy_pass <%= ENV["API_V2_BACKEND"] %>;
  proxy_redirect default;
}
```

You need to define the two environment variables `API_V1_BACKEND` and `API_V2_BACKEND` with the domain name of the applications. For instance:

```
scalingo env-set API_V1_BACKEND=https://my-app-1.osc-fr1.scalingo.io
scalingo env-set API_V2_BACKEND=https://my-app-2.osc-fr1.scalingo.io
```

This configuration must be written in the `nginx.conf.erb` file at the root of
your application.

#### Setup throttling with a `limit_req_zone`

This configuration example lets you throttle the traffic to a Scalingo
application:

```nginx
# instruction at the http level like
limit_req_zone $binary_remote_addr zone=one:10m rate=1r/s;

server {
    server_name localhost;
    listen <%= ENV['PORT'] %>;
    charset utf-8;
    location / {
        limit_req zone=one burst=5;
        proxy_pass http://<%= ENV["API_V1_BACKEND"] %>;
    }
}
```

This configuration must be written in the `servers.conf.erb` file at the root of
your application.

## Output

The application deployment output will look like:

```text
-----> Cloning custom buildpack: https://github.com/Scalingo/nginx-buildpack.git#master
-----> Bundling NGINX 1.10.1
```

## Multiple Configuration Files

You may want to use multiple configuration files in your application. This is
possible with the `NGINX_INCLUDES` environment variable:

```bash
scalingo --app my-app env-set NGINX_INCLUDES="./conf/nginx-1.conf ./conf/nginx-2.conf"
```
