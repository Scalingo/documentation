In order to provision larger than free tiers resources, or when the [free
trial][free-trial] period is over, each [Scalingo account][account] must have a
**billing profile**.

This profile stores all the information we need to be able to generate invoices
for the services you consume. It also allows you to chose and configure at
least one payment method.


## Filling Your Billing Profile

1. From your web browser, open your [billing profile][billing-profile]
2. From the **Billing** submenu, make sure to select the **Billing profile**
   tab
3. Click the **Add billing informations** button
4. In the popup window, fill the form with the appropriate information (some
   fields are mandatory for legal reasons)
5. Validate by clicking the **Save these billing informations** button
6. Go on and [add a payment method][payment-add]
