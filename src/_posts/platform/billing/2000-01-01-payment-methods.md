Scalingo currently supports three payments methods:

- **Debit/Credit Card**\
  This is the easiest and most commonly used payment method.

- **Prepaid Credits**\
  We also support buying credits **via Paypal**.

- **SEPA**\
  Because of past abuses, SEPA payments are only available **under strict
  conditions**. Please note that **all conditions must be fulfilled to
  qualify**.

  - You **must** be located in the European Union
  - You **must** have **at least** 3 consecutive invoices with an amount higher
    or equal to 100€ successfully paid via another payment method

  If you think to qualify, please get in touch with our Support team to setup
  SEPA payments.


## Adding a Payment Method

Scalingo supports adding multiple payment methods. If you have multiple payment
methods setup, Scalingo only tries to charge the one you set as the preferred
one. The platform **does not** fallback on other payment methods in case of
failure.
