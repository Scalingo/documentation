## Invoicing

At the beginning of each month, Scalingo computes your consumption for the
expired month and generates an invoice. The consumption is based on the
lifespan of the resources used by each of your apps. This includes containers,
add-ons, databases, one-off containers, review-apps, etc.

{% note %}
Most of our products and services are billed by the minute.
{% endnote %}

The platform then tries to get paid using your preferred payment method.


## Payment Failure

### Fixing Payment Failure

It can happen that a payment of a bill fails. There are many reasons for that:
credit card expiration, bank rejectionâ€¦

In such a case:

1. **Update** an existing payment method **or add a new one**
   - If you are paying via prepaid credits and you don't have enough credits,
     the invoice is considered as **unpaid**. You will have to add enough
     credits to pay the invoice.
   - If you are paying via credit card, the platform marks your invoice as
     **unpaid** after the first payment failure. You will have to resolve the
     issue (most of the time the card has simply expired).

2. Scalingo automatically retries the payment several times before quitting.
   If the payment still fails, the account is **suspended**, which means all
   the applications and addons linked to the account are put on hold.

3. If the situation is not fixed after a while, we may delete the apps and
   data.

{% note %}
Please get in touch with our Support team if you are facing a difficult
situation related to the payments of your invoices.
{% endnote %}

### Recovering From a Suspended Account

To fully recover after your account has been suspended:

1. From your web browser, open your [dashboard][dashboard]
2. Select the app you want to resume
3. If the app has a database addon, resume it
4. [Scale your application's][scale-h] containers to a value > 0
5. Your application is back online
