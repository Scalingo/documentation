## Invoicing

At the beginning of each month, Scalingo computes your consumption for the
expired month and generates an invoice. The consumption is based on the
lifespan of the resources used by each of your apps. This includes containers,
add-ons, databases, one-off containers, review-apps, etc.

Most of our products and services are billed by the minute.

The platform then tries to get paid. FIXME


## Payment Failure

It can happen that a payment of a bill fails. There are many reasons for that:
credit card expiration, bank rejectionâ€¦ In such case, you need to update an
existing payment method or add a new one. Then Scalingo automatically retries
the payment and you are good to go!

If you bought prepaid-credit with PayPal and that you have not enough credit to
pay the invoice, the invoice will be considered **unpaid** and you have to add
more credit.

If you add a payment card, the platform tries to charge it when the invoice is
generated. If the operation fails, the invoice will be considered **unpaid**.
The charge operation is then retried automatically a few times before the
account is suspended and the data deleted.

To resolve the issue, you can either add prepaid credit or update your payment
method during this period. The new payment method will be charged right away to
cover the unpaid invoice.
