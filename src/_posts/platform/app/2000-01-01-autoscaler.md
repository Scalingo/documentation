The ***Scalingo Autoscaler*** is a feature that, once configured and enabled,
allows the platform to automatically and dynamically adjust the number of
containers of your application (horizontal scaling) depending on a performance
metric while remaining within strict boundaries to prevent unforeseen costs.


## Understanding the Autoscaler

An Autoscaler is linked to a [process type]({% post_url platform/app/2000-01-01-procfile %}),
which means you can have multiple Autoscalers for the same application, as long
as each one is setup for a different process type. Each Autoscaler can be setup
differently.

When the configured metric deviates from the defined *target*, the Autoscaler
automatically adjusts the number of containers of the process type, either up
or down, to maintain the specified target.

The Autoscaler considers the following parameters to decide what to do and when
to take action:

- **Hysteresis**: the Autoscaler decision is based on the "mean per minute" of
  the target metric. Two consecutive means over the target value are required
  for the Autoscaler to boot an additional container
- **Aggregation**: for CPU, RAM and swap metrics, the mean of all containers is
  used
- **Cooldown (scale-out)**: after a scale-out event, the Autoscaler does not
  scale the application out again for at least one minute
- **Cooldown (scale-in)**: after a scale-in event, the cooldown period is three
  minutes
- **Step**: by default, the Autoscaler adds only one container per decision
  round, ensuring a progressive and controlled adjustment. When the metric is
  RPM per minute, the Autoscaler is able to add more than one container per
  decision round when required, allowing to scale much faster. The maximum
  number of containers limit is still honoured in such a case.

These rules are designed to prevent the application from scaling wildly. They
make autoscaling effective at handling moderately increasing or decreasing
metrics, but less effective at managing sudden, massive spikes. For such cases,
and considering they are predictable, we usually adivse to manually scale the
application to an appropriate container formation.


## Chosing a Metric

An Autoscaler can depend on 6 different metrics:

| Metric                                                                   | Kind        | Keyword             |
| ------------------------------------------------------------------------ | ----------- | ------------------- |
| [Requests Per Minute (RPM) per container](rpm-per-container-recommended) | `router`    | `rpm_per_container` |
| [Response Time](#response-time)                                          | `router`    | `p95_response_time` |
| [Number of 5xx errors](#5xx-errors)                                      | `router`    | `5XX`               |
| [CPU consumption](#cpu-consumption)                                      | `technical` | `cpu`               |
| [RAM consumption](#ram-consumption)                                      | `technical` | `memory`            |
| [Swap consumption](#swap-consumption)                                    | `technical` | `swap`              |

### RPM per container (recommended)

Requests Per Minute (RPM) per container is calculated as the total number of
requests received by your application divided by the number of running `web`
containers.

#### Usage

For applications with fluctuating traffic, this metric helps maintain a stable
user experience by dynamically adding or removing containers to meet demand
without overprovisioning.

#### Recommended Target

The target for RPM per container should be determined by performing small-scale
load tests on your application. This helps understand how containers respond
under different levels of traffic, ensuring the Autoscaler can scale
effectively when needed.

### Response Time

Response time measures the latency of your application in processing requests.
The Autoscaler focuses on typical application performance by evaluating the
[95th percentile](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Burstable_billing%2395th_percentile)
of response times. This ensures that scaling decisions are not influenced by
outlier spikes.

#### Usage

This metric is particularly relevant for applications where user satisfaction
is tied to responsiveness. Monitoring response time ensures that the
application scales to meet performance expectations.

#### Recommended Target

A good response time target depends on the criticality of your application's
speed.

Note that this metric might not always point to container saturation, it can
also reflect external factors such as a database performance issue, a slow
access to external online resources, or application-level bottlenecks.

### 5xx Errors

This metric monitors server-side errors, such as 500 Internal Server Errors,
which indicate issues with your application or backend. The Autoscaler
evaluates the frequency of 5xx errors per minute to determine whether scaling
adjustments are needed.

#### Usage

This metric is particularly valuable for maintaining the reliability of your
application under stress. For example, if the number of errors increases due to
insufficient resources during peak traffic, scaling-out can stabilize the
system. However, persistent errors may indicate deeper issues, such as bugs,
database bottlenecks, or misconfigured dependencies, which should be addressed
directly.

#### Recommended Target

The target threshold for 5xx errors per minute should be defined based on your
application's behavior and tolerance for errors. Applications with strict
reliability requirements typically require a low threshold, while others may
tolerate occasional errors during peak loads.

### CPU Consumption

CPU consumption measures the average CPU usage across all containers. It
reflects how computationally intensive your application workload is.

#### Usage

This metric is commonly used for compute-intensive applications. When CPU
consumption frequently exceeds the target, the Autoscaler adds containers to
distribute the load.

However, if high CPU usage persists despite autoscaling, it may indicate that
your application requires more powerful containers to run properly. In such
cases, switching for a larger plan (vertical scaling) can provide more CPU
priority per container, thus enhancing the ability of your application to deal
with resource-intensive scenarios.

#### Recommended target

The recommended target for CPU consumption is 90% of the total CPU capacity,
ensuring your application uses resources efficiently without reaching
saturation.

### RAM Consumption

RAM consumption monitors the memory usage across all containers. Applications
with high memory needs, such as those handling large datasets or caching, can
benefit from autoscaling based on this metric.

#### Usage

This metric is particularly relevant for memory-bound applications. If your
application frequently exhausts its RAM allocation, autoscaling will help
distribute the workload to additional containers.

#### Recommended target

A target of 90% RAM usage is usually recommended, allowing a safety buffer to
prevent out-of-memory errors and ensure smooth operations.

### Swap Consumption

Swap consumption tracks the use of disk-based swap memory, which occurs when an
application exceeds its allocated RAM. While swap provides additional capacity,
excessive usage can significantly degrade performance.

#### Usage

Monitoring swap consumption helps prevent performance degradation. When swap
usage exceeds the target, the Autoscaler adds containers to reduce the load on
existing instances.

#### Recommended target

The recommended target for swap consumption is 10%. This ensures that your
application uses RAM efficiently without relying heavily on slower disk-based
swap.


## Defining a Relevant Target

We provide a recommended value for each metric that you can use as the target.
For router metrics, these values are computed based on the median of your
application's usage over the last 24 hours. This means they are solely based on
historical data and do not include any future predictions.

Finding the best scaling target for your application is not an easy task. You
should run benchmarks on your application to identify which metric is the
bottleneck. A good approach is to scale the application down to 1 container and
use a load testing tool (e.g. Vegeta) to stress test it.

We also usually advise to keep a small margin when defining a target. For
example, if you notice your application stops responding after 100 RPM, setting
the target to 80 RPM per container would be a reasonable choice. This ensures
the platform can automatically scale out your application as needed, in time.
For the most accurate results, these load tests should focus on the most
resource-intensive endpoints of your application.


## Limitations

- The minimum number of containers **must** be 2 to guarantee a minimal
  tolerance to fault. Allowing to scale-in to fewer than 2 containers would
  break the application high availability and create a risk of disruption in
  case of a failure. This would moreover go against our 99.96% Service Level
  Agreement.
- Router metrics are only available for containers running the `web` [process
  type]({% post_url platform/app/2000-01-01-procfile %}). However, technical
  metrics are available for all types of process types.


## Costs

Although the Scalingo Autoscaler itself is free, the additional containers
started during a scale-out operation are billed like any other container (on
the other hand, scaling-in allows to save costs).

Consequently, billing depends on the type of container you chose for your
application (M is the default container size), on the maximum number of
containers set in the Autoscaler configuration and on your application
workload.


## Creating an Autoscaler

{% warning %}
Adding an Autoscaler also immediately enables it!\
Since this can lead to additional costs, please make sure to chose appropriate
options and values before validating.\
[It can be disabled](#disabling-an-autoscaler) if needed.
{% endwarning %}

### Using the Dashboard

1. From your web browser, open your application dashboard
2. Click on the **Resources** tab
3. Locate the **Containers** block
4. In this block, locate the **Scale** button next to the process type for
   which you want to setup the Autoscaler
5. Click the down arrow next to the **Scale** button
6. From the dropdown menu, select **Setup autoscaler**
7. The following popup window appears:
{% assign img_url = 'https://cdn.scalingo.com/documentation/screenshot_dashboard_autoscalers.png' %}
{% include mdl_img.html %}
{:start="8"}
8. In the popup window:
   1. Pick the minimum number of containers for this process type
      (minimum is 2)
   2. Pick the maximum number of containers for this process type
   3. Chose the metric to watch
   4. Chose a value above which the Autoscaler considers scaling-out
   5. Validate by clicking the **Confirm** button
9. **The Autoscaler is configured and enabled**

### Using the Command Line

1. Make sure you have correctly [setup the Scalingo command line tool]({% post_url platform/cli/2000-01-01-start %})
2. From the command line, run the following command to setup the Autoscaler:
   ```bash
   scalingo --app my-app autoscalers-add --container-type <process_type> \
       --metric <metric> --target <target> \
       --minimum-containers <min> --maximum-containers <max>
   ```
   With:
   - `process_type`\
     Name of the process type to scale (e.g. `web`, `clock`, `scheduler`, ...)
   - `metric`\
     Name of the metric to watch.\
     Please refer to the *Keyword* column of the [metrics table](#available-metrics)
     for available values.
   - `target`\
     The value for metric that serves as boundary to trigger a scale operation
   - `min`\
     Minimum number of containers to run
   - `max`\
     Maximum number of containers to run

   The output should look like this:
   ```bash
   -----> Autoscaler created on my-app for web containers
   ```
3. **The Autoscaler is configured and enabled.**

### Using the Terraform Provider

1. Create the following `resource` blocks in your Terraform file to create the
   Autoscaler and attach it to your app:
   ```tf
   resource "scalingo_autoscaler" "web_autoscaler" {
     app = scalingo_app.my-app.id
     container_type = "web"
     min_containers = 2
     max_containers = 10
     metric = "rpm_per_container"
     target = 1000
   }
   ```
   In this example, we create an Autoscaler that will start to scale-out the
   `web` process type when the total number of requests received by the
   application divided by the number of running `web` containers exceeds 1000.
   It will start a maximum of 10 containers.\
   Please refer to the *Keyword* column of the [metrics table](#available-metrics)
   for available values.
2. Run `terraform plan` and check if the result looks good
3. If so, run `terraform apply`
4. After a few seconds, your Autoscaler is setup and enabled


## Enabling the Autoscaler

When enabling an Autoscaler:
- Depending on the current state, the platform may decide to either scale-out
  (i.e. boot up additional containers) or scale-in (destroy excess containers)
  to fulfill its configuration.

### Using the Dashboard

1. From your web browser, open your application dashboard
2. Click on the **Resources** tab
3. Locate the **Containers** block
4. In this block, locate the **Scale** button next to the process type for
   which you want to enable the Autoscaler
5. Click the down arrow next to the **Scale** button
6. From the dropdown menu, select **Re-enable autoscaler**

### Using the Command Line

1. Make sure you have correctly [setup the Scalingo command line tool]({% post_url platform/cli/2000-01-01-start %})
2. Make sure you have [added and configured an Autoscaler](#configuring-an-autoscaler)
3. From the command line, enable the Autoscaler:
   ```bash
   scalingo --app my-app autoscalers-enable <process_type>
   ```
   Where `process_type` is the name of the process type for which you want to
   enable an Autoscaler (in most cases, `web`).

   The output should look like this:
   ```bash
   -----> Autoscaler updated on my-app for web containers
   ```

### Using the Terraform Provider

1. Update the Autoscaler `resource` in your Terraform file like so:
   ```tf
   resource "scalingo_autoscaler" "web_autoscaler" {
     [...]
     disabled = false
   }
   ```
2. Run `terraform plan` and check if the result looks good
3. If so, run `terraform apply`
4. After a few seconds, the Autoscaler is enabled and running again


## Disabling an Autoscaler

When disabling an Autoscaler:
- The platform does not scale-in. The number of running containers remains the
  same. You can still scale manually if needed.
- The current Autoscaler configuration is kept, so you can [re-enable it](#enabling-an-autoscaler)
  whenever needed.

### Using the Dashboard

1. From your web browser, open your application dashboard
2. Click on the **Resources** tab
3. Locate the **Containers** block
4. In this block, locate the **Scale** button next to the process type for
   which you want to disable the Autoscaler
5. Click the down arrow next to the **Scale** button
6. From the dropdown menu, select **Disable autoscaler**

### Using the Command Line

1. Make sure you have correctly [setup the Scalingo command line tool]({% post_url platform/cli/2000-01-01-start %})
2. Make sure you have [added and configured an Autoscaler](#configuring-an-autoscaler)
3. From the command line, disable the Autoscaler:
   ```bash
   scalingo --app my-app autoscalers-disable <process_type>
   ```
   Where `process_type` is the name of the process type for which you want to
   disable the Autoscaler (in most cases, `web`).

   The output should look like this:
   ```bash
   -----> Autoscaler updated on my-app for web containers
   ```

### Using the Terraform Provider

1. Update the Autoscaler `resource` in your Terraform file like so:
   ```tf
   resource "scalingo_autoscaler" "web_autoscaler" {
     [...]
     disabled = true
   }
   ```
2. Run `terraform plan` and check if the result looks good
3. If so, run `terraform apply`
4. After a few seconds, the Autoscaler is disabled
