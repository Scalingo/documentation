{% warning %}
This feature is currently beta preview only available for some customers. If you are interested in taking part to the beta, please contact the Scalingo support.
{% endwarning %}

With the Private Networks feature, Scalingo offers the ability to group applications and limit the public exposition of some applications. It protects these applications so that they are not reachable by a resource from outside the private network. It also adds encryption for the communications between the applications inside the private network.

Inside a private network, all the containers can communicate with TCP or UDP on any ports.

We explain in this page how to join the Private Networks beta program, some known limitations, and a use case.

## How Do I Protect My Application With a Private Network?

Here is the process to take part to the private network beta:
- Contact our support team to show your interest in the beta
- Read and accept the Beta special terms agreement.
- Create an [empty project]({% post_url platform/projects/2000-01-01-overview %}) and notify the support about its name.
- ðŸš€ After the support enabled private network on your project, you can migrate applications into the project or create new ones inside it. All these applications are protected inside a private network.

{% note %}
Note that HDS applications do NOT have access to the feature during the beta preview.

## Domain Names

In order to reference the containers in private networks, domain names are created to ease the interaction between them. A domain name is composed of the <code>container number</code> (optional), <code class="domain-name-ct">container type</code> (optional), the <code class="domain-name-ap">application ID</code>, the <code class="domain-name-pn">private network ID</code> and a common <code class="domain-name-nid">internal network identifier</code> (<code class="domain-name-nid">private-network.internal</code>).

Here are some examples with an
application <code class="domain-name-ap">ap-a71da13f-7c70-4c00-a644-eee8558d8053</code> and a
private network <code class="domain-name-pn">pn-ad0fd6a1-d05e-40ea-bf63-c4f8a75a9d8c</code>:

* <code><span class="domain-name-ap">ap-a71da13f-7c70-4c00-a644-eee8558d8053</span>.<span class="domain-name-pn">pn-ad0fd6a1-d05e-40ea-bf63-c4f8a75a9d8c</span>.<span class="domain-name-nid">private-network.internal.</span></code>

  DNS A records to the `web` containers. `web` containers are the default containers contacted when using the application domain name (optional prefixes excluded).

* <code><span class="domain-name-ct">web</span>.<span class="domain-name-ap">ap-a71da13f-7c70-4c00-a644-eee8558d8053</span>.<span class="domain-name-pn">pn-ad0fd6a1-d05e-40ea-bf63-c4f8a75a9d8c</span>.<span class="domain-name-nid">private-network.internal.</span></code>

  DNS A records to the `web` containers.

* <code>1.<span class="domain-name-ct">web</span>.<span class="domain-name-ap">ap-a71da13f-7c70-4c00-a644-eee8558d8053</span>.<span class="domain-name-pn">pn-ad0fd6a1-d05e-40ea-bf63-c4f8a75a9d8c</span>.<span class="domain-name-nid">private-network.internal.</span></code>

  DNS A record to the first `web` container.

* <code><span class="domain-name-ct">worker</span>.<span class="domain-name-ap">ap-a71da13f-7c70-4c00-a644-eee8558d8053</span>.<span class="domain-name-pn">pn-ad0fd6a1-d05e-40ea-bf63-c4f8a75a9d8c</span>.<span class="domain-name-nid">private-network.internal.</span></code>

  DNS A records to the `worker` containers.

* <code>1.<span class="domain-name-ct">worker</span>.<span class="domain-name-ap">ap-a71da13f-7c70-4c00-a644-eee8558d8053</span>.<span class="domain-name-pn">pn-ad0fd6a1-d05e-40ea-bf63-c4f8a75a9d8c</span>.<span class="domain-name-nid">private-network.internal.</span></code>

  DNS A record to the first `worker` container.

These domain names can be inferred by knowing the application ID, the private network ID and the application formation or you can list them using [Scalingo CLI]({% post_url tools/cli/2000-01-01-start %}):

```
scalingo --app my-app private-networks-domain-names
```

## Known Limitations

By deploying a web application inside a private network, and reaching it using its internal domain name, some Scalingo features will no longer be available:

- The [router logs]({% post_url platform/app/2000-01-01-logs %}) will no longer display a log line for each request. This is because these requests no longer go through our front routers. Hence we no longer have the ability to track these requests and log them.

- There is no monitoring for requests between the containers inside a private network. Hence the router metrics (e.g. "Requests per Minute" or "Response Time") are not available for containers deployed inside a private network and not publicly available. As a consequence, it is not possible to [autoscale]({% post_url platform/app/scaling/2000-01-01-scalingo-autoscaler %}) these containers based on the router metrics.

- The load balancing for requests is based on DNS. For example, to target a `worker` container, one can use the domain name <code><span class="domain-name-ct">worker</span>.<span class="domain-name-ap">ap-a71da13f-7c70-4c00-a644-eee8558d8053</span>.<span class="domain-name-pn">pn-ad0fd6a1-d05e-40ea-bf63-c4f8a75a9d8c</span>.<span class="domain-name-nid">private-network.internal.</span></code>. The DNS request to get this domain name records returns a set of `A` records. The choice of which record to use is left to the DNS client used.

## Typical Use Cases

### A Web Application Firewall To Protect the Web Containers

A typical use case would be to deploy a backend application that is protected behind a Web Application Firewall (WAF). You may want to completely hide the backend application so that it's unreachable from outside the private network. That way, the traffic must go through the WAF before reaching your backend application.

In this section we explain the different steps to achieve this kind of architecture with private network.

1. You first need to create the backend application inside the project with private network enabled.
2. This application will be web-less. You must first scale down the `web` containers by following [these steps]({% post_url platform/app/2000-01-01-web-less-app %}).
3. Then deploy an application which listens on the TCP port you want (e.g. 3000). The [`Procfile`]({% post_url platform/app/2000-01-01-procfile %}) must name its process with a different name than `web` (e.g. `my-app-backend`).

At this point, you have a backend application that you cannot query with the public domain name provided by Scalingo (e.g. `my-app.osc-fr1.scalingo.io`).

We will now deploy the Web Application Firewall in charge of filtering and forwarding the requests to the backend application. This application is a [Nginx with ModSecurity]({% post_url platform/getting-started/2000-01-01-getting-started-with-modsecurity %}). Your `nginx.conf` configuration file would look like:

```nginx
location / {
  proxy_pass http://my-app-backend.ap-uuid.pn-uuid.private-network.internal:3000;
  proxy_redirect default;
}
```

With <code><span class="domain-name-ct">my-app-backend</span>.<span class="domain-name-ap">ap-uuid</span>.<span class="domain-name-pn">pn-uuid</span>.<span class="domain-name-nid">private-network.internal.</span></code> the domain name of your backend containers.

After deploying the application, one can query the Nginx with the public domain name and access the backend application.
