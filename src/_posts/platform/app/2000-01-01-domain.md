Scalingo provides a subdomain which looks like `osc-fr1.scalingo.io` for all
applications to access your application. Of course, you may want to use your
own domain name. This operation requires different configuration operations:

## Buy a Domain Name

We do not sell domain names. You can buy one from a company which sells them
(called registrar) such as:

* DNS Simple - https://dnsimple.com/
* OVH - https://www.ovh.com
* Gandi - https://www.gandi.net

You can find an exhaustive list of registrars on the [ICANN
website](https://www.icann.org/registrar-reports/accredited-list.html). The
process is pretty similar with any of these services. You search for the
availability of the domain and if it is available, you can buy it per
year.

## Configure Your Application

Let's say you bought the domain name `example.com`. You first need to
configure your Scalingo application to accept requests to this domain. You can
achieve this with our [CLI](https://cli.scalingo.com), or through our
[dashboard](https://dashboard.scalingo.com).

{% note %}
  There is a soft limit of 20 domains allowed per application.
  Feel free to reach the support if you need more domains for your application.
{% endnote %}

### Using Our CLI

```bash
scalingo --app my-app domains-add <domain name>
```
{% note %}
  Our CLI is not currently supporting [wildcard certificates](#wildcard-domain).
  If you want to add a [wildcard certificate](#wildcard-domain),
  please use the [web dashboard](#using-the-web-dashboard).
{% endnote %}

### Using the Web Dashboard

Go to the 'Domains' tab of your app dashboard, fill the 'Domain Name' text field and validate
by clicking on 'Link domain name to the app'.

{% assign img_url = "https://cdn.scalingo.com/documentation/screenshot_dashboard_domains.png" %}
{% include mdl_img.html %}

## Configure Your Domain Name

After having bought a domain name you need to configure it. Most of the
registrars provide a web dashboard to do so. To target your application
hosted on Scalingo, you need to create a `CNAME` field targeting the
fully qualified domain name (FQDN). This FQDN depends on the region your
application is deployed on:

- `osc-fr1`: `my-app.osc-fr1.scalingo.io.`
- `osc-secnum-fr1`: `my-app.osc-secnum-fr1.scalingo.io.`

### Example

The raw configuration line to create an alias between `www.example.com`
and `my-app.osc-fr1.scalingo.io` is:

```
NAME   TTL      TYPE  FIELD    TARGET
www    10800    IN    CNAME    my-app.osc-fr1.scalingo.io.
```


{% note %}
  This operation is not instantaneous. DNS propagation can take up to days to be completely done.
{% endnote %}

After this configuration is completed, a [Let's Encrypt certificate]({%
post_url platform/app/2000-01-01-ssl
%}#automatic-https-certificate-with-lets-encrypt) is automatically generated
for your application. If the propagation took time, it's possible the next
check to generate a certificate is scheduled in a couple of hours, (it's
following an exponential backoff algorithm to retry the generation). In this
case, you might want to accelerate the process: you can detach and re-attach
the domain to the application, our system will then try to generate a
certificate immediately.

## Root Domain

Most of the registrars only allow `A` field for root domains. However `A` should target an IP. As Scalingo
don't ensure that our front IP addresses won't change over time, we advise you to use a subdomain for your
application or to migrate your domain name to another DNS provider.

Some providers allow to create `ALIAS`, `ANAME` or `CNAME` field for root domains:

* DNSimple (ALIAS)
* DNS Made Easy (ANAME)
* easyDNS (ANAME)
* Cloudflare (CNAME)
* PointDNS (ALIAS)

If you want to keep your registrar which is not compatible with root domain
aliases, you can create `A` fields targeting our web entrypoints. These IP
depend on the region your application is deployed on:

* `osc-fr1`: 4 A fields
  * `5.104.101.30`
  * `109.232.236.90`
  * `109.232.233.130`
  * `148.253.75.120`
* `osc-secnum-fr1`: 4 A fields
  * `148.253.96.193`
  * `185.21.194.105`
  * `80.247.12.255`
  * `80.247.13.145`

{% note %}
  These IP addresses may change in the future.
  In this case, you will receive an email at least 30 days in advance to
  inform you that you have to change your domain configuration.
{% endnote %}

## Wildcard Domain

### App Configuration

You may want to redirect all subdomains of your domain to a specific Scalingo
application. To achieve this you've to add a domain name with the form:

* `*.example.com`
* `*.subdomain.example.com`

And also add a CNAME field targeting your application FQDN, just like with any
[regular domain name](#configure-your-domain-name).

Then all requests targeting for instance `www.example.com` or
`admin.example.com` will be redirected to this specific application.

Once you have added your wildcard domain, we automatically generate a Let's
Encrypt certificate. But to complete the generation, you need to create a TXT
record in your zone. This allows [Let's Encrypt certificate]({% post_url
platform/app/2000-01-01-ssl %}#automatic-https-certificate-with-lets-encrypt) to
know that you are the owner of the wildcard domain. This is highlighted by the
"Action Required" status on the web dashboard. Clicking on the question mark
gives you the instruction to update your TXT record.

Here is an example of the DNS configuration for the domain `*.example.com`:

```
NAME                         TTL   TYPE    VALUE
_acme-challenge.example.com  120   TXT     5TWm4V7xoUpGax-58FrPO49
```

This TXT record must be updated every three months to renew the certificate. In
case you fear to forget to do this modification, we support automatic update of
this value for some DNS providers (see the list below). All you have to do is to
give us some credentials for the DNS providers APIs. You can do this by setting
up some environment variables (see the [Environment variables]({% post_url
platform/app/2000-01-01-environment %}) section).

#### Azure DNS

If your domain is managed by Azure DNS, you can add the following variables:

    DNS_PROVIDER=azure
    DNS_AZURE_CLIENT_ID=<your_azure_client_id>
    DNS_AZURE_CLIENT_SECRET=<your_azure_client_secret>
    DNS_AZURE_SUBSCRIPTION_ID=<your_azure_subscription_id>
    DNS_AZURE_TENANT_ID=<your_azure_tenant_id>
    DNS_AZURE_RESOURCE_GROUP=<your_azure_resource_group>

To obtain your keys, first login on the [Azure Portal](https://portal.azure.com/). Then follow these steps:
* Create an Application: go on Azure Active Directory > App Registrations > New application registration. Fill the form (the Sign-on URL is completely arbitrary).
* Get your `Client ID`: After created your app, stay on the page. Copy the `Application ID`. This is your `Client ID`.
* Get your `Client Secret`: On the same page, go on Settings > Keys. Enter a description and a duration, then Save. Make sure to copy the key before leaving the page, you won't be able to retrieve after you leave. This is your `Client Secret`
* Get your `Subscription ID`: Go on Subscriptions. Copy your `Subscription ID`.
* Get your `Tenant ID`: Go on Azure Active Directory > Properties. Copy the `Directory ID`. This is your `Tenant ID`.
* Get your `Resource Group`: Go on DNS Zone > Select your zone > Overview > Copy the `Resource Group`.

Now you have to create a Role for your application. Go on Subscriptions > Select your subscription > Access Control (IAM) > Add > Select `DNS Zone Contributor` and assign it to your application. Just type the name of your application and select it. Save.

That's all! You can use the Azure DNS with Scalingo.

Others providers will be add to the platform. If your provider is not in the list, you have to create
the TXT record manually.

After this configuration is completed, a [Let's Encrypt certificate]({%
post_url platform/app/2000-01-01-ssl %}#automatic-https-certificate-with-lets-encrypt) is automatically generated for your
application.

{% note %}
  This operation is not instantaneous. DNS propagation can take up to days to be completely done.
{% endnote %}

### Renewal wildcard domain

In order to renew a wildcard domain, you will need to create a new TXT record for your zone, to prove that you are
the owner of the domain.

If you use the supported providers, everything is setup automagically. But if your DNS provider is not supported
by our platform, you will receive an email to remember you that you have to create a new TXT record to renew your
[Let's Encrypt certificate]({%post_url platform/app/2000-01-01-ssl %}#automatic-https-certificate-with-lets-encrypt)

### Priorities

If an application has the wildcard domain `*.example.com` configured and that another application
is using `admin.example.com`, the wildcard will not override the `admin` subdomain. Actually, any
complete subdomain will have priority over the wildcard.

### DNS Configuration

If you need to redirect all the subdomains to Scalingo servers, you need to setup your DNS
accordingly, it's really close to configuring a single domain name:

    NAME   TTL      TYPE  FIELD    TARGET
    *      10800    IN    CNAME    my-app.osc-fr1.scalingo.io.

{% note %}
  This operation is not instantaneous. DNS propagation can take up to days to be completely done.
{% endnote %}

### Note

When you add an alias, we don't do any prior verification. If you cannot add
your alias because it's already taken on Scalingo and you think you're legit to
use it, send an email to [support@scalingo.com](mailto:support@scalingo.com)
describing the problem.

### Security

The wildcard you add to your domain name is protected by a mechanism that ensures it can only be used by you. For instance, if you add a wildcard such as `*.y.z` and register an application called A with the subdomain `x.y.z` using your user account (`my-user`), no other user (e.g. `evil-user`) can register any other subdomain such as `evil.y.z` for their application B. The mechanism checks whether the owner of the application for the subdomain `evil.y.z` is the same as for any other subdomain registered with the wildcard. In this case, `my-user` for application A is different from `evil-user` for application B.

## Canonical Domain

After defining multiple domains on an application, one can need to redirect all
requests towards its application to a specific domain. This domain is called
the __canonical domain__. The canonical domain can be defined in the Settings
tab of the dashboard.

Note that when a wildcard domain is defined for an application, a second domain
must be added to be set as canonical. For instance, let's say that
`*.example.com` is in the list of domains of an app. If `www.example.com` is
the wanted canonical domain, it must be added to the list of domains to be
selectable as a canonical domain.

The redirection to the canonical domain will be made with a [HTTP 301 status code](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HTTP_301).
