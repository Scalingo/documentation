## \*.scalingo.io Domain

By default you can access your application using the following domain name:
`my-app.region-name.scalingo.io`. Replace `region-name` with the region where
you have created your application (e.g. `osc-fr1`).

HTTPS is enabled by default for those domains and we recommend you to use it by
default to ensure the encryption of the requests to your apps.

We provide a valid certificate which is recognized by all modern browsers and
HTTP clients.

If you have a custom domain configured, we provide a valid certificate thanks to
[Let's Encrypt certificate](#automatic-https-certificate-with-lets-encrypt).

You can also choose to use your own certificate. We use **SNI** in such case.
To understand what it is and why it is useful, you can read more here:
[SNI on Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Server_Name_Indication).

## Custom Domain

### Automatic HTTPS Certificate with Let's Encrypt

You can add [your own domain name]({% post_url platform/app/2000-01-01-domain %}) to
access your application. By default HTTPS is enabled, and fully functional thanks to
[Let's Encrypt certificate](https://letsencrypt.org/).

By default, we automatically generate a certificate for every
domain added to the platform. Let's Encrypt certificates have a 90 days validity. We follow Let's Encrypt
recommendation and renew them every 60 days automatically. You do not need to do anything manually!

If you prefer to use a certificate signed by a different certificate authority, feel free to add
it by following [the instructions](#generate-your-own-certificate-manually).

If you forget to renew your custom certificate and it expires, or if you delete it, a Let's
Encrypt certificate will automatically and immediately replace it. Hence your application will
always be available using HTTPS.

If your DNS configuration is not valid or if we fail to generate a
certificate, the platform will automatically retry to generate it later.
The time between those tries is determined using an exponential backoff algorithm.
We will wait 1 minute for the first retry, 2 minutes for the second, 4 minutes for the third and so on.
This algorithm is capped at a minimum of one try per day.

#### Limit: Number of Certificate per Domain

The platform is limited by official [Let's Encrypt
quotas](https://letsencrypt.org/docs/rate-limits).

There is a maximum of 50 generated certificates per domain per week. The **domain** here mentions the root domain, so having a certificate for `www.example.com`, `app.example.com` and `example.com` counts for 3.

#### Let's Encrypt Certificate Statuses

On the dashboard, you may find your Let's Encrypt certificate with various statuses:

* Pending DNS: when you link a domain name to your application, we wait for it to target our
  infrastructure before generating the certificate. We check the DNS record automatically every 60 seconds.
* Creating: our infrastructure is exchanging messages with Let's Encrypt servers to generate your
  certificate.
* In use: your website is available using HTTPS connections thanks to a Let's Encrypt certificate.
* Not used: your website is available using HTTPS connections thanks to a custom certificate. If it
  expires or if you remove it, your website will be available using HTTPS connections thanks to a
  Let's Encrypt certificate.
* Action required: to achieve the creation of your Let's Encrypt certificates for a wildcard domain,
  you may be asked to do something.
  See [wildcard domain documentation]({% post_url platform/app/2000-01-01-domain %}#wildcard-domain) for more information.

#### Disable Let's Encrypt Certificate Generation

As explained on this page, by default we try to generate Let's Encrypt TLS certificate for all domains
added to **applications**. However you might want to disable completely this feature. You can do it by
creating your domain with our command line tool or directly through our
[API](https://developers.scalingo.com)

```bash
scalingo --app my-app domains-add --no-letsencrypt www.example.com
```

That way, we will never contact Let's Encrypt servers for the given domain.

### Increase your Domain Name Security

One way to increase a domain name security is to configure a DNS record of type CAA. It let you
specifies which certificate authority is allowed to generate a TLS certificate for your domain name.
Not all DNS provider let you configure this record. You can find a non-comprehensive list of
providers which support it on [this page](https://sslmate.com/caa/support). If your domain name is
`example.com`, you can indicate that only Let's Encrypt is allowed to generate a certificate for
this subdomain and all subdomain with:

```
example.com.  IN  CAA 0 issue "letsencrypt.org"
```

More information about CAA record on the [Let's Encrypt
documentation](https://letsencrypt.org/docs/caa/).

### Generate your Own Certificate Manually

You can add [your own domain name]({% post_url platform/app/2000-01-01-domain %}) to
access your application. By default HTTPS is enabled, and fully functional thanks to
[Let's Encrypt certificate](#automatic-https-certificate-with-lets-encrypt).

If you want to use a custom certificate, signed by a different certificate authority,
you can still add it. Here are the different steps to follow:

{% note %}
  <strong>SSL/TLS certificates are free on Scalingo.</strong>
{% endnote %}

#### 1. Create a RSA key pair and a signing request

```
openssl req -new -newkey rsa:2048 -sha256 -nodes -keyout app.key -out app.csr
```

You have to enter different information regarding your certificate, but have
particular look at:

* __Country Name__: It has to be the two letters representing your country following the
[ISO 3166-1](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ISO_3166-1_alpha-2)
* __Common Name__: This is the domain name you want to secure. (Example: `www.example.com`)

Two files have been generated:

* `app.key`: The private key, you have to keep secret
* `app.csr`: The signing request, which has to be signed by a trusted third-party

{% note %}
  This command creates a RSA key of 2048 bytes length, you can adapt this
  value if you wish a stronger key. However, we do not recommend you to use a
  lower encryption key size.
{% endnote %}

#### 2. Submit your request to generate a valid certificate

Your `app.csr` file has to be signed by an external entity. This service is, in most
of the cases, charged by the authority. But some companies provide certificates
for free.

#### Certificate Authorities

| Provider                                                     | Key Information                                                     |

#### CDN & Edge Providers

| Provider                                          | Key Information                          |
|---------------------------------------------------|------------------------------------------|
| [**Gcore**](https://gcore.com/edge-network/cdn)   | European CDN with a free tier and SSL    |
| [**Cloudflare**](https://www.cloudflare.com/ssl/) | Free SSL termination and DDoS protection |

These are examples, there are other companies providing this service.

#### 3. Upload your key and certificate

{% note %}
  Note that both your key and your certificate must be in the [PEM
  format](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Privacy-enhanced_Electronic_Mail)
{% endnote %}

You can use our [command line utility](https://cli.scalingo.com) or our web dashboard
to upload your key and certificate

With the CLI:

```bash
# If the doman has already been defined
scalingo domains-ssl --cert ./app.crt --key ./app.key www.example.com

# If it is a new domain
scalingo domains-add --cert ./app.crt --key ./app.key www.example.com
```

From our dashboard:

1. From your web browser, open your [dashboard][dashboard]
2. Click the **Settings** tab
3. Select **Public Routing** menu
4. Click on the pen icon of the concerned domain
5. Select the certificate you want to use and the key
6. Click **Upload**


In both cases (CLI or Dashboard) the modification is applied instantly.

### How to Upload Certificate Chains

A lot of certificate authorities provide certificate chains or bundles alongside
your signed certificate (most common is the Certification Authority, but they may
supply any intermediary certificates).

To upload all those certificates, you have to create one file, with all the
certificates concatenated in the
[PEM format](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Privacy-enhanced_Electronic_Mail).
This is a textual format, so any text editor is able to do it.

#### File Formats and Conversions

Your certificates may have been supplied in a binary format: if you
have a `.cer`, `.crt` or `.der` file, it _should_ be binary. But those
extensions are sometimes used for PEM files too.

{% note %}
  These file formats (and extensions) are part of a standard called
  [X.509](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/X.509), which is why your provider
  may have given you "X509 certificates". This is the generic name for the
  certificates format.
{% endnote %}

You can check by opening the file with a text editor: if you see
"BEGIN CERTIFICATE", then it's textual. If this is a binary file, your editor
should tell you so.

In the latter case, you can convert it to text using `openssl`. The following command
should work on Linux-based OS and macOS:

```
openssl x509 -inform DER -in <yourcertificate.crt> -out yourcertificate.pem
```

#### Creating the Bundle

Create a file (for instance, `certificate.pem`). First add your certificate,
then append all the intermediate certificates of the certificate chain:

Example:

```bash
-----BEGIN CERTIFICATE-----
.... your certificate
-----END CERTIFICATE-----
-----BEGIN CERTIFICATE-----
.... intermediate certificate 1
-----END CERTIFICATE-----
-----BEGIN CERTIFICATE-----
.... intermediate certificate 2
-----END CERTIFICATE-----
```

{% note %}
  You can use online services to verify your certificate chain. For example:
  [ssllabs.com](https://www.ssllabs.com/ssltest/). Note that on the second
  certificate, it is totally normal to see the mention 'No SNI' and 'MISMATCH'
  on Scalingo's hosts.
{% endnote %}

## When it Expires or you Delete it

If you forget to renew your certificate and it expires, or if you delete it, a Let's
Encrypt certificate will automatically and immediately replace it. Hence your application will
always be available using HTTPS.
