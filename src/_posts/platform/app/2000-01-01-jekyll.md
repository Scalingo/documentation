## Using Jekyll

Jekyll is a static site generator written with Ruby. In order to generate your static files, you need a Ruby
environment, and a Node.js environment to serve the files, as seen before.

As Scalingo provides [Multi Buildpacks]({% post_url platform/deployment/buildpacks/2000-01-01-multi %}) support, you can
combine the two environments needed to build your application. To achieve this, you can add a `.buildpacks` file at the root
of your project, containing the Ruby buildpack, and the Node.js buildpack:

```
https://github.com/Scalingo/ruby-buildpack
https://github.com/Scalingo/nodejs-buildpack
```

{% note %}
The Node.js buildpack being used for running our application, it must come last!
{% endnote %}

The procedure is very similar to the one explained in the [static files hosting page]({% post_url platform/app/2000-01-01-static-files-hosting %}). But here we add a build task to our `package.json` file,
which builds your Jekyll application:

```json
{
  "name" : "my-application",
  "version" : "1.0.0",
  "dependencies" : {
    "express" : "4.x"
  },
  "scripts" : {
    "build": "bundle exec jekyll build",
    "start": "node server.js"
  }
}
```

Adapt your `server.js` file just a bit, in order to make the `.html` extension in your URL optional:

```js
var express = require('express');

var app = express();
var directory = '/' + (process.env.STATIC_DIR || 'dist')
app.use(express.static(__dirname + directory), { extensions: 'html'});

var port = process.env.PORT || 3000;
app.listen(port, function () {
  console.log('Listening on', port);
});
```

And your app is now ready to go!
