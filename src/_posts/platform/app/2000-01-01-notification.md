A notifier is a way for an application to notify about different events occurring during an
application lifetime. Notifier are defined per application. You can find the settings into the
"Notifications" tab of your app.

A notifier have:
* a name: help you identify a notifier,
* a communication channel: Slack, webhook, Rocket.Chat, email,
* a list of events to react to. You can find a list of events below.

Whenever an event occurs in your application, a notification is sent through the user-defined
communication channel.

You can refer to [Slack
documentation](https://get.slack.help/hc/en-us/articles/115005265063-Incoming-WebHooks-for-Slack#set-up-incoming-webhooks)
about "Incoming Webhooks" to help you set this channel up on Scalingo.

Note that notifiers are also used to send [alerts]({% post_url platform/app/2000-01-01-alerts %})
generated by an application.

Note that Mattermost notifications require using the Slack notifier.
