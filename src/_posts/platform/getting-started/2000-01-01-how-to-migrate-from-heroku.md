Scalingo is a Platform as a Service [highly compatible with Heroku]({% post_url platform/getting-started/2000-01-01-heroku-compatibility %}). This page is here to help you migrate from Heroku to Scalingo as easily as possible.

## Requirements

To be able to follow this tutorial, we assume that you have:

- [A Scalingo account](https://auth.scalingo.com/users/sign_up)
- The Scalingo [CLI]({% post_url platform/cli/2000-01-01-start %}) installed
- A local copy of the repository containing your app’s code ([How can I download my code from Heroku?](https://help.heroku.com/FZDDCBLB/how-can-i-download-my-code-from-heroku))

Please ensure you are running all commands above from the root of the repository containing your app’s code. 

```bash
$ cd <app directory>
```

All operations described below can also be executed through [our dashboard](https://dashboard.scalingo.com).

## Migration Steps

### Creating your Scalingo app

- Start by logging in to the Scalingo platform using our CLI:

```bash
$ scalingo login
```

- You can now create your app:

```bash
# Replace my-app with your actual app name
$ scalingo create my-app
```

### Configure Environment Variables

- First, retrieve the environment variables from your current Heroku app context:

```bash
$ heroku config
```

- Those environment variables need to be declared in your Scalingo app context. For instance, this command will set the `NODE_ENV` environment variable:  

```bash
$ scalingo --app my-app env-set NODE_ENV=production
```

More information about environment variables can be found in the [dedicated documentation page]({% post_url platform/app/2000-01-01-environment %}).

### Deploying Your App

- You are now ready to deploy your app on Scalingo:

```bash
$ git push scalingo master
```

### Database Migration

- Once you have set your Scalingo addons according to those you had on Heroku, you need to migrate your database by dumping it from Heroku and restoring it to Scalingo. 
  * [Dump and restore a Scalingo for MongoDB® database]({% post_url databases/mongodb/2000-01-01-dump-restore %})
  * [Dump]({% post_url databases/postgresql/2000-01-01-backing-up %}#dumping-the-database)
    and [restore]({% post_url databases/postgresql/2000-01-01-restoring %}#restoring-a-dump)
    a Scalingo for PostgreSQL® database
  * [Dump]({% post_url databases/mysql/2000-01-01-backing-up %}#dumping-the-database)
    and [restore]({% post_url databases/mysql/2000-01-01-restoring %}#restoring-a-dump)
    a Scalingo for MySQL® database.

### Where to Go Next?

- If your app is using a custom domain, follow the [instructions]({% post_url platform/app/2000-01-01-domain %}) to update your DNS configuration.
- Managing your [SSL certificate]({% post_url platform/app/2000-01-01-ssl %}).
