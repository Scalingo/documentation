Projects offer a new way to organize your applications and resources. They let you group applications into logical units that reflect your organization's structure: by product, customer, environment, or any other approach that fits your needs.

{% note %}
**Today** projects are flexible: applications can still be moved or regrouped freely. 

Starting **March 1, 2026**, projects will become a core structural element of the Scalingo platform. This means that applications will no longer be movable between projects, and projects themselves will serve as the foundation for future platform features.
{% endnote %}

{% warning %}
We strongly recommend grouping your applications into projects before **March 1, 2026**. After this date, applications can no longer be regrouped or moved between projects, except by recreating them in the target project.

## Why use Projects?

Projects provide a structured way to separate applications according to your own logic, 
whether by product, customer, environment, or any other approach that fits your needs. This makes large accounts easier to navigate and manage, while keeping resources clearly organized.

In the near future, Projects will also become the cornerstone of application billing, advanced access controls, and network-related security features. Private networks are one of the upcoming capabilities that will build on top of Projects. By starting to group your applications into Projects today, you ensure that your organization is ready to take full advantage of these future improvements.

## Default Project

The project named **default** is created automatically when your account is set up. By default, this project is used for any application or resource that is not explicitly assigned to another project. You can rename this project at any time, or designate any of your other projects as the new default one to better match your organization's needs.

## Current Limitations

- Currently, only the owner of a project or an app can move an application between projects.
- Projects cannot be deleted from the Dashboard, they can be [removed using the CLI, API or Terraform][removing-project].
- Collaborators may not see all applications within a project. They only see the applications to which they have been individually added. User management remains at the application level for now, until more granular access controls are introduced at the organizational and project levels.
- Accounts are limited to 20 projects to prevent misuse. This limit can be raised depending on your needs by contacting our support team.

## Transition Timeline

We are introducing a transition period with clear milestones:

- September 1, 2025: all existing resources have automatically been assigned to a Project named **default**.
- September 15, 2025: start of the transition period with the introduction of Projects. At this stage, projects remain flexible, and applications can still be regrouped freely.
- Ahead of March 1, 2026: new interfaces and management capabilities will be introduced to strengthen the role of Projects as a core element of the platform and improve the overall experience.
- By March 1, 2026: Projects will become a fixed and foundational component of the platform. From this date, applications can no longer be regrouped between projects.  
- After this date, moving a single application from one project to another will no longer be possible. Changing a project for an application will require recreating and redeploying it in the target project.

{% warning %}
We strongly recommend grouping your applications into projects before the deadline to ensure a smooth transition as they become a core element of the Scalingo platform.
