Projects offer a new way to organize your applications. By grouping your resources into projects now, you are preparing for upcoming features focused on the network isolation of your applications and environments.

{% note %}
We encourage you to group your applications into projects now.
This will prepare you for upcoming features (such as private networks) and ensure smooth transition, as moving applications between projects will eventually require downtime.

## Why use Projects?

Projects provide a structured way to separate applications according to your own logic, 
whether by product, customer, environment, or any other approach that fits your needs. This makes large accounts easier to navigate and manage, while keeping resources clearly organized.

In the near future, Projects will become the cornerstone for application billing, security, and network isolation. While these advanced features are not yet available, introducing Projects today gives you the opportunity to start aligning your applications with this organizational model. By grouping your apps into Projects now, you will be better prepared to take full advantage of these upcoming capabilities.

## Default Project

Every owner starts with a Project named default, which serves as the initial workspace. This Project can be renamed at any time to better reflect the organizationâ€™s needs.

## Current Limitations

- Currently, only the owner of a project or an app can move an application between projects.
- Projects cannot be deleted from the Dashboard, they can only be [removed using the CLI or API][removing-project].
- Collaborators may not see all applications within a project. They only see the applications to which they have been individually added. User management remains at the application level for now, until more granular access controls are introduced at the organizational and project levels.
- Accounts are limited to 100 projects to prevent abuse. This limit can be raised depending on your needs by contacting our support team.
