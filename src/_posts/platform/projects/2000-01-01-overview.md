Projects offer a new way to organize your applications and resources. They let you group applications into logical units that reflect your organization's structure: by product, customer, environment, or any other approach that fits your needs.  

{% note %}
Today, projects are flexible: applications can still be regrouped freely. But starting **March 1, 2026**, projects will become isolated, each running on its own dedicated network. This shift will strengthen security and isolation, while requiring you to structure your applications in projects ahead of time.
{% endnote %}

{% warning %}
We strongly recommend grouping your applications into projects before **March 1, 2026**. After this date, applications can no longer be regrouped between projects except by recreating them in the target project.

## Why use Projects?

Projects provide a structured way to separate applications according to your own logic, 
whether by product, customer, environment, or any other approach that fits your needs. This makes large accounts easier to navigate and manage, while keeping resources clearly organized.

In the near future, Projects will become the cornerstone for application billing, security, and network isolation. While these advanced features are not yet available, introducing Projects today gives you the opportunity to start aligning your applications with this organizational model. By grouping your apps into Projects now, you will be better prepared to take full advantage of these upcoming capabilities.

## Default Project

The project named **default** is created automatically when your account is set up. By default, this project is used for any application or resource that is not explicitly assigned to another project. You can rename this project at any time, or designate any of your other projects as the new default one to better match your organization's needs.

## Current Limitations

- Currently, only the owner of a project or an app can move an application between projects.
- Projects cannot be deleted from the Dashboard, they can only be [removed using the CLI or API][removing-project].
- Collaborators may not see all applications within a project. They only see the applications to which they have been individually added. User management remains at the application level for now, until more granular access controls are introduced at the organizational and project levels.
- Accounts are limited to 20 projects to prevent abuse. This limit can be raised depending on your needs by contacting our support team.

## Transition Period: From Flexible to Isolated Projects

To prepare for the activation of advanced networking features, we are introducing a transition period with clear milestones:

- September 15, 2025: start of the transition period with the introduction of Projects in beta. At this stage, projects are still flexible, meaning applications can be regrouped freely between them.
- Q1 2026: new interfaces will be introduced to simplify the management of isolated projects and ease the transition.
- By March 1, 2026: **projects will become isolated**, each running on its own Private Network. From this date, applications can no longer be regrouped between projects.
- After this date, moving a single application will no longer be possible. Instead, entire projects will need to be transferred as a unit.

{% warning %}
We strongly recommend grouping your applications into projects before the deadline to ensure a smooth transition from today's flexible model to tomorrow's isolated and secure environments.
