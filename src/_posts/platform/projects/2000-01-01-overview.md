Projects offer a new way to organize your applications and resources. They let you group applications into logical units that reflect your organization's structure: by product, customer, environment, or any other approach that fits your needs.

[Learn how to manage your projects][project-management-page].


## Why use Projects?

Projects provide a structured way to separate applications according to your own logic, 
whether by product, customer, environment, or any other approach that fits your needs. This makes large accounts easier to navigate and manage, while keeping resources clearly organized.

In the near future, Projects will also become the cornerstone of application billing, advanced access controls, and network-related security features. Private networks are one of the upcoming capabilities that will build on top of Projects. By starting to group your applications into Projects today, you ensure that your organization is ready to take full advantage of these future improvements.


## Default Project

The project named **default** is created automatically when your account is set up. By default, this project is used for any application or resource that is not explicitly assigned to another project. You can rename this project at any time, or designate any of your other projects as the new default one to better match your organization's needs.


## Current Limitations

- Currently, only the owner of a project or an app can move an application between projects.
- Collaborators may not see all applications within a project. They only see the applications to which they have been individually added. User management remains at the application level for now, until more granular access controls are introduced at the organizational and project levels.
- Accounts are limited to 20 projects to prevent misuse. This limit can be raised depending on your needs by contacting our support team.
