## Introduction

Projects help to structure your resources by gathering them. They're the first milestone of features that will come later like network isolation for instance.

The project named **⭐ default** is present by default and is set as a default project on existing Apps.

{% note %}
You're encouraged to assign your apps to projects now.
By doing this, you prepare the arrival of some of the future features, that in the end will make the gathering of resources per projects necessary.
{% endnote %}
