Scalingo offers a referral program that allows users to earn credits by inviting others to the platform.

## How It Works

* Referral Link: Each user has a unique [referral link](https://dashboard.scalingo.com/account/referrals) available in their dashboard.  
* Earnings: When someone signs up using your referral link and becomes a paying customer, you receive 20% of their monthly usage as credits.  
* Duration: This benefit lasts for 12 months from the referred userâ€™s account creation date.  
* Credit application: Earned credits are automatically applied to your future invoices.

## Tracking Referrals

You can monitor your referral statistics, including the number of sign-ups and credits earned, directly from the [referral section](https://dashboard.scalingo.com/account/referrals) in your dashboard.
