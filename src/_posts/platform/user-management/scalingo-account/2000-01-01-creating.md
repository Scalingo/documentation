Each user of Scalingo has a personal account that is sovereign and independent.

It can be used to sign-in to Scalingo, create and manage applications,
provision databases and add-ons, define a payment method, download invoices,
access detailed consumption reports, work collaboratively by inviting teammates
or joining an app, etc. In a word, a Scalingo account is mandatory to use
Scalingo.

There are two ways to create your Scalingo account:
  - [Using an e-mail address and password](#using-an-e-mail-address)
  - [Using GitHub Single Sign On](#using-github-sso) (SSO)


## Using an E-Mail Address

1. Open the [sign up][sign-up] page
2. Either select **Professional** or **Personal**, depending on your situation
3. Enter the e-mail address you want to use for your Scalingo account
4. Chose a **strong** password
5. Validate by clicking the **Create my account** button


## Using GitHub SSO

1. Open the [sign up][sign-up] page
2. Click the **Create my account using GitHub** button
3. You are redirected to GitHub where you are asked to grant Scalingo access to
   specific personal information associated with your GitHub account. This
   allows us to check your identity and get your e-mail address (the one
   associated with your GitHub account)

{% note %}
Using this method unlocks deeper integration between GitHub and Scalingo.
Please refer to our page dedicated to [SCM integration][scm] to learn more
about these features.
