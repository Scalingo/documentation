Inviting collaborators allows you to share access to specific applications
while preserving full control and accountability. This feature is designed to
support seamless teamwork from development to production.

Granting collaborator access should be done with care. While collaborators
cannot delete an application, they still hold sufficient privileges to modify
configurations, deploy new code, or scale resources. These actions can impact
the stability or availability of your services.

Consequently, it is essential to assign new collaborators the appropriate role
based on their responsibilities. [Roles][roles] define the level of access and
actions a user can perform on your applications and databases.


## Listing all Collaborators

### Using the Dashboard

1. From your web browser, open your [dashboard][dashboard]
2. The consolidated list of all users collaborating on all your apps, along
   with their 2FA status, is available from the **Collaborators** tab
3. (optional) The **Group by** buttons allow to group the list either by
   collaborator or by app.


## Exporting Collaborators

### Using the Dashboard

1. From your web browser, open your [dashboard][dashboard]
2. Click the **Collaborators** tab
3. Click the **Export as CSV** button to export the list of collaborators in
   CSV format. The list is also available in JSON format from the drop-down.


## Listing Collaborators of an App

### Using the Dashboard

1. From your web browser, open your [dashboard][dashboard]
2. Click the **Apps** tab
3. Click on the application for which you want to manage your collaborators
4. Click the **Settings** tab
5. In the **Settings** submenu, make sure to select **Collaborators**

### Using the Command Line

1. Make sure you have correctly [setup the Scalingo command line tool][cli]
2. From the command line, list le collaborators of the app:
   ```shell
   scalingo --app my-app collaborators
   ```
   The output should look like this:
   ```text
   ┌──────────────────────────────┬──────────┬──────────┐
   │            EMAIL             │ USERNAME │  STATUS  │
   ├──────────────────────────────┼──────────┼──────────┤
   │ user1@example.com            │ user1    │ owner    │
   │ user2@example.com            │ user2    │ accepted │
   │ user3@example.com            │ n/a      │ pending  │
   └──────────────────────────────┴──────────┴──────────┘
   ```


## Adding a Collaborator

{% note %}
While the main Collaborators page provides a consolidated list, collaborators
are managed individually for each application.
{% endnote %}

### Using the Dashboard

1. From your web browser, open your [dashboard][dashboard]
2. Click the **Apps** tab
3. Click on the application for which you want to add a collaborator
4. Click the **Settings** tab
5. In the **Settings** submenu, make sure to select **Collaborators**
6. Click the **Add** button
7. Fill the input field with the e-mail address of the collaborator.
   If they already have a Scalingo account, use this e-mail address
8. The collaborator is added, and shows up dimmed in the list
9. An invite is sent by e-mail to the collaborator
10. Once the invite accepted, the collaborator shows up normally in the list

### Using the Command Line

1. Make sure you have correctly [setup the Scalingo command line tool][cli]
2. From the command line, invite someone:
   ```shell
   scalingo --app my-app collaborators-add user@example.com
   ```
   The output should look like this:
   ```text
   -----> user@example.com has been invited to collaborate to my-app
   ```

### Using the Terraform Provider

1. Place the following `resource` block in your Terraform file FIXME:
   ```tf
   locals {
     team = ["user1@example.com", "user2@example.com"]
   }

   resource "scalingo_collaborator" "collaborators" {
     for_each = toset(local.team)

     app   = "${scalingo_app.my-app.id}"
     email = each.key
   }
   ```
   In this example, we invite two users (user1@example.com and
   user2@example.com) to work on an app named `my-app` (which must exist).


## Updating a Collaborator's Role

## Removing a Collaborator

{% warning %}
- When revoking permissions from a user, environment variables and other
  credentials are not changed. Users can still directly access services if they
  know the service credentials. To fully revoke access, make sure to rotate all
  relevant secrets, such as database passwords and API tokens.

- At the moment, updating the password of the default database user requires
  assistance from the Scalingo support team. Once the password is changed, you
  must manually update the associated environment variable and restart the
  parent application for the new credentials to be used.
{% endwarning %}

   locals {
     team = ["user1@example.com", "user2@example.com"]
   }
