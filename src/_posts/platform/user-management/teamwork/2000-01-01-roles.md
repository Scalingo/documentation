Scalingo currently provides three predefined roles to help you adapt
permissions to the level of responsibility you want to delegate to your
collaborators: [**Owner**](#owner), [**Collaborator**](#collaborator) and
[**Limited Collaborator**](#limited-collaborator).


## Owner

Reserved for the application owner, the **Owner** role grants the highest level
of permissions, including full administrative control such as deleting or
transferring the application. The Owner is also the one who is billed for the
application's usage.


## Collaborator

The **Collaborator** role is intended for trusted team members who are directly
responsible for the configuration, deployment, and operational maintenance of
applications and databases. It grants broad permissions, including access to
environment variables, hosted data, deployment settings, and collaborator
management, making it suitable for lead developers or DevOps engineers who need
full technical control over the application.

While collaborators can perform almost all actions, including inviting and
managing other users, they cannot delete, rename, or transfer the application.
Those actions remain reserved for the Owner.

{% note %}
This role should only be assigned to individuals you fully trust, as it allows
unrestricted access to sensitive data and the ability to make impactful changes
to the application environment.
{% endnote %}


## Limited Collaborator

The **Limited Collaborator** role is designed to minimize the risks associated
with granting access to third parties or collaborators without operational
responsibility. It allows contributors to perform essential day-to-day
operations such as restarting applications, viewing logs or metrics, and
managing review apps while preventing actions that could compromise the
stability, confidentiality, or integrity of your services.

This role explicitly restricts access to critical operations like modifying
configurations, deploying unvalidated code, exploring or exporting sensitive
data and managing collaborators.

It is especially suited for environments where separation of duties is
required. It ensures that users can contribute to the project without being
able to compromise service stability, data integrity, or team governance.

{% note %}
In most cases, we recommend assigning the Limited Collaborator role by default,
unless the user explicitly needs full access to configuration, data, or
collaborator management.

## Role Capabilities

### Overview

The following table provides a synthetic overview of the main permissions
associated with each role. In most cases, it should be enough to select the
role that best suits your collaborators. However, we also provide an
[exhaustive list of access rights associated with each
role](#permissions-matrices).

### Permissions Matrices

The following tables detail the permissions available to collaborators of an
app, grouped by scope, and differentiated according to the collaborator's role.
The **Owner** role is not listed, as it holds full and unrestricted access to
all application resources.
