Scalingo allows you to easily collaborate with others while maintaining full
control over your applications, databases and environments.

To do so, Scalingo allows to [invite other Scalingo
accounts][managing-collaborators] to team up and work jointly on an app.

An app can have as many collaborators as needed.

We currently provide three predefined roles to help you adapt permissions to
the level of responsibility you want to delegate to your collaborators:
[**Owner**][role-owner], [**Collaborator**][role-collaborator] and
[**Limited Collaborator**][role-limited-collaborator].

Make sure to have a look at our [best practices][best-practices] to get the
best from our user management features.
