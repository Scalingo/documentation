Applications on Scalingo run inside Linux containers. These containers are built on a base image maintained by Scalingo, which itself is derived from the official Docker image of a well-known Linux distribution.

Scalingo currently supports two stacks based on Ubuntu LTS. The corresponding base Docker images are open source and can be found on the Docker hub:

| Name | Base Distribution | Supported Until | Docker Hub |
| ---- | ----------------- | --------------- | ---------- |
| [scalingo-22]({% post_url platform/internals/stacks/2000-01-01-scalingo-22-stack %}) | Ubuntu 22.04 | April 2027 | [scalingo/scalingo-22](https://hub.docker.com/r/scalingo/scalingo-22) |
| [scalingo-20]({% post_url platform/internals/stacks/2000-01-01-scalingo-20-stack %}) | Ubuntu 20.04 | April 2025 | [scalingo/scalingo-20](https://hub.docker.com/r/scalingo/scalingo-20) |

All Scalingo-supported buildpacks are compatible with supported stacks.

The default stack for all newly created applications is `scalingo-22`.

These base images are used for all applications hosted on the
platform, as a result, it is a *generic image* which is *unspecialized*.
That's why they are based on a stable **Ubuntu LTS** environment.

## Viewing Stack Used by your Application

The stack used by your application is available using Scalingo [CLI]({%
post_url platform/cli/2000-01-01-start %}):

```shell
scalingo --app my-app apps-info
+----------------+-------------+
|    SETTINGS    |    VALUE    |
+----------------+-------------+
[...]
| Stack          | scalingo-22 |
[...]
+----------------+-------------+
```

## Migrating to a New Stack

Updating the stack requires building a new image and redeploying it. We recommend testing your applications in a controlled environment before making changes in production.

You can migrate to the latest stack with:

```shell
scalingo --app my-app stacks-set scalingo-22
```

Then redeploy your application:

```shell
git commit --allow-empty -m "Upgrading to scalingo-22"
git push scalingo master
```

You can view the list of all available stacks with the [CLI]({% post_url
platform/cli/2000-01-01-start %}):

```shell
scalingo stacks
```

### Using a Staging Application

It is advisable to first test this change on a staging application. You may
already have such staging application hosted on Scalingo. In such situation, the
above-mentioned migration steps can be applied to it.

### Using a Review App

Otherwise, a nice solution to test the stack upgrade without affecting your
currently running application is to create a [review app]({% post_url
platform/app/2000-01-01-review-apps %}) and add a `scalingo.json` file
containing:

```json
{
  "stack": "scalingo-22"
}
```

Make sure your review app deploys successfully and works flawlessly. Once your
application is ready for the new stack, migrate to the desired stack and redeploy
with the method described above.

## The Build Process

Each time any user deploys a new release of their applications, a new container
image is created. A new layer is added on top of the base
image. It's built using the buildpack and contains the application code and all
its dependencies. When the build is done, the resulting image is sent to
our private repository and our orchestrator will use it subsequently to actually
run the application in our infrastructure.

The **maximum build time is 30 minutes**. After that duration the build will be cancelled by the platform.

## Installed Libraries

We've installed different libraries and softwares which are commonly used in
the build process or used by human when running [one-off
container]({% post_url platform/app/2000-01-01-tasks %}).

You'll find:

* Build essentials utility (GCC, make, autotools, ...)
* Curl, git, telnet, ssh, ssh-client, openssl, dnsutils, sqlite
* Node.js, Ruby, Perl, Python, Java
* ImageMagick

The advantage of using a single base image is that **once it has been
fetched on a hosting node, we're done**. Even if we sacrifice a few megabytes
of disk space, when a new container starts, only the application layer is
fetched and nothing else.

Of course you can inspect this base image: it's a completely standard Docker
image after all! You can use something like:

```console
$ docker pull scalingo/scalingo-22
$ docker run --rm -it scalingo/scalingo-22:latest bash
```

## Timezone

The timezone configured inside our base image is UTC±00:00. You can set it to a
different value by setting the environment variable `TZ` with the desired
timezone:

```
scalingo --app my-app env-set TZ=Europe/Paris
```

A list of existing timezones is available
[here](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_tz_database_time_zones#List).
