## Fill the Billing Profile

In order to provision larger than free tiers resources, or when your free trial is over, you need to fill your billing profile. Go to [https://dashboard.scalingo.com/billing](https://dashboard.scalingo.com/billing) and fill the form.

## Priority Between Means of Payment

Scalingo offers various means of payment and you can complete multiple of them
in your [billing profile](https://dashboard.scalingo.com/billing). When a new bill is
generated for your account, Scalingo charges the different means of payment in
this order:

- Scalingo Credit,
- Credit Card,
- Paypal,
- SEPA.

## How to pay via SEPA

{% warning %}
You must have paid 3 consecutive invoices with an amount higher or equal to 100â‚¬ using your credit card or Paypal.
{% endwarning %}

If you check the requirement above or if it's a blocker for you, contact us on the support at [support@scalingo.com](mailto:support@scalingo.com).


## What Happens in Case of Failed Payment?

It can happen that a payment of a bill fails. There are many reasons for that:
credit card expiration, bank rejection... In such case, you need to update an
existing payment method or add a new one. Then Scalingo automatically retries the
payment and you are good to go!
