## Your consumption report

Scalingo lets you follow your consumption directly in your dashboard. Go to [https://dashboard.scalingo.com/consumption](https://dashboard.scalingo.com/consumption) and you'll see your consumption report for the current month.

{% note %}
The amounts shown are frozen at the end of each billing period. An application transferred during the month is billed to its new owner, even if you can see its consumption for the period prior to its transfer.
{% endnote %}

## Current or past periods

This report shows the consumption of all your applications for the current billing period and is updated daily at midnight UTC.

When a billing period is over and the invoice is issued, you can explore your consumption to identify the main cost drivers.

Please note that the consumption report document **is not an invoice**, but a breakdown of your consumption **excluding VAT**. It does not take into account the free trial period or any vouchers or credits.

## Group consumption by app or ressource

Consumption are grouped by App by default. This makes it easy to identify the applications that consume the most resources and represent the largest cost centre.

If you wish, we can also group them by Resource.

## Export as CSV or JSON

We know how important it is for you to extract and integrate your data into your own information system. That's why you can quickly and easily export them as CSV or JSON files.
