## Consult your consumption report

Scalingo lets you follow your consumption directly in your dashboard . Go to [https://dashboard.scalingo.com/consumption](https://dashboard.scalingo.com/consumption) and you'll see the consumption for the current month.

The consumption report document is not an invoice, but a breakdown of your consumption excluding VAT. It does not take into account the free trial period or any vouchers or credits.

{% note %}
The amounts shown are frozen at the end of each billing period. An application transferred during the month is billed to its new owner, even if you can see its consumption for the period prior to its transfer.
{% endnote %}

## Group consumption by app or ressource

Consumption are grouped by App by default. This makes it easy to identify the applications that consume the most resources and represent the largest cost centre.

If you wish, we can also group them by Resource.

## Export as CSV or JSON

We know how important it is for you to be able to extract your data and integrate it into your own information system. That's why you can export them quickly and easily as CSV or JSON files.
