Bigger container sizes are available upon request on the support.
As a note, each new process requires a PID. And inside each process, each thread needs one too.

## Availability of the Sizes

Our 30 days free trial only gives you access to small and medium containers, if you want
to use another kind of size, please [fill your billing profile and payment
method](https://dashboard.scalingo.com/billing).

## Container Limits

Containers have various limits depending on their size. Here is a comprehensive list:

- RAM: cf. above-mentioned table
- Swap: twice the amount of RAM.
- CPU access: all containers have access to all CPU cores. But higher priority
  means twice as much priority compared to standard priority. For example,
  consider three containers, one has a high priority and two others have a
  standard priority. When processes in all three containers attempt to use
  100% of CPU, the first container would receive 50% of the total CPU time and
  the two others would receive 25%.
- PID limits: from 128 (S) to 2048 (2XL).
- Ulimit nofile: 10000. Maximum number of files an application can open.
