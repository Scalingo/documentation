Health Data Hosting (HDS) certification is part of Scalingo's broader [compliance framework]({% post_url security/overview/2000-01-01-compliance %}). In France, it helps ensure that health data hosting is operated with security controls aligned with regulatory requirements and supports use cases with heightened security and compliance constraints.

## When should I create an HDS resource?

You should create HDS resources when your application processes personal health data, or when you operate for stakeholders subject to HDS compliance requirements (healthcare institutions, healthcare professionals, Health Tech publishers, and public health organizations).

In practice, if your workload must comply with reinforced requirements for security, traceability, and health data hosting in France, it must be deployed on HDS-eligible resources.


## What is the difference between standard and HDS resources?

With equivalent specifications, HDS services do not imply direct additional costs, but they enforce eligibility constraints.

### Managed Application Runtime

- The platform enforces `web` processes scaled to 2 or more containers to ensure high availability.

### Managed Database

- Only highly available service classes ([`Business` and `Enterprise`]({% post_url databases/about/2000-01-01-overview %}#service-classes)) of eligible databases can be used for HDS workloads.
- Scalingo for Elasticsearch®, Scalingo for MongoDB®, and Scalingo for InfluxDB® are not eligible for HDS workloads.


## How to create an HDS-eligible application

To create an HDS-compliant application:

1. [Create a new application]({% post_url platform/app/2000-01-01-lifecycle-management %}#create-an-application) and enable `Health data hosting`
2. Accept the latest version of the HDS contract appendix
3. Create or update your [Health Professional Point of Contact]({% post_url compliance/2000-01-01-hds %}#en-hds-health-professional-point-of-contact)
4. No manual configuration is required: the platform enforces HDS constraints, including `web` processes scaled to 2 or more containers

{% note %}
HDS must be enabled when the application is created. It is not possible to convert an existing non-HDS application to HDS afterward.
{% endnote %}


## How to create a Shared Resources HDS database add-on

When the parent application is HDS, the platform enforces add-on eligibility automatically.

Any database add-on created for an HDS application must be HDS-eligible. For shared resources, this means using an eligible highly available `Business` service class.
