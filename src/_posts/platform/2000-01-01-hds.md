Health Data Hosting (HDS) certification is part of Scalingo's broader [compliance framework][compliance]. In France, it helps ensure that health data hosting is operated with security controls aligned with regulatory requirements and supports use cases with heightened security and compliance constraints.

## When should I create an HDS resource?

You should create resources with HDS coverage when your application processes personal health data in a context subject to French HDS requirements, or when you operate for stakeholders subject to HDS compliance requirements (healthcare institutions, healthcare professionals, Health Tech publishers, and public health organizations).

In practice, if your workload must comply with reinforced requirements for security, traceability, and health data hosting in France, it must be deployed on resources covered by HDS certification.


## What is the difference between standard and HDS resources?

With equivalent specifications, **HDS coverage does not imply a direct surcharge**, but it enforces constraints that may require larger resource plans.

### Application Runtime

- The platform enforces `web` processes scaled to 2 or more containers to ensure high availability.

### Database

- Only highly available service classes ([`Business` and `Enterprise`][service-classes]) are eligible for HDS database workloads.
- Scalingo for Elasticsearch®, Scalingo for MongoDB®, and Scalingo for InfluxDB® are not eligible for HDS workloads.


## How to enable HDS coverage on a resource

HDS coverage must be enabled when the resource is created. Existing resources 
without HDS coverage cannot be converted later.

### Application Runtime

To make your application HDS-compliant, enable the HDS option when creating it.

The full procedure is documented in the application lifecycle page:
[Create an HDS Application][app-create-hds].

No manual configuration is required after creation. The platform enforces HDS
constraints, including `web` processes scaled to 2 or more containers.

### Shared Resources HDS database add-on

When the parent application is HDS-compliant, the platform automatically 
enforces add-on eligibility.

No manual configuration is required after creation. The platform automatically 
applies HDS coverage constraints and uses a highly available `Business` service 
class.

### Dedicated Resources HDS database

To enable HDS coverage on a Dedicated Resources database, activate the HDS 
option at creation time.

No manual configuration is required after creation. The platform automatically 
applies HDS coverage constraints and uses a highly available `Business` or 
`Enterprise` service classes.
