## Is pricing different for HDS managed services?

No. HDS managed services do not incur additional costs compared to non-HDS services with equivalent resources.
However, they are subject to additional constraints.

## What restrictions apply to HDS managed services?

### Managed Application Runtime

- Run at least 2 `web` containers to ensure high availability.

### Managed Database

- Use only eligible highly available service classes ([`Business` or `Enterprise`]({% post_url databases/about/2000-01-01-overview %}#service-classes)) for HDS workloads.
- Elasticsearch, MongoDB and InfluxDB are not eligible for HDS workloads.
