Health Data Hosting (HDS) certification is part of Scalingo's broader [compliance framework][compliance]. In France, it helps ensure that health data hosting is operated with security controls aligned with regulatory requirements and supports use cases with heightened security and compliance constraints.

- Details of our [HDS certification][hds], including scope, validity, and requirements

## When should I create an HDS resource?

You should create HDS resources when your application processes personal health data in a context subject to French HDS requirements, or when you operate for stakeholders subject to HDS compliance requirements (healthcare institutions, healthcare professionals, Health Tech publishers, and public health organizations).

In practice, if your workload must comply with reinforced requirements for security, traceability, and health data hosting in France, it must be deployed on HDS-eligible resources.


## What is the difference between standard and HDS resources?

With equivalent specifications, HDS services do not imply a direct HDS surcharge, but they enforce eligibility constraints that may increase the required resource sizing.

### Managed Application Runtime

- The platform enforces `web` processes scaled to 2 or more containers to ensure high availability.

### Managed Database

- Only highly available service classes ([`Business` and `Enterprise`][service-classes]) of eligible databases can be used for HDS workloads.
- Scalingo for Elasticsearch®, Scalingo for MongoDB®, and Scalingo for InfluxDB® are not eligible for HDS workloads.


## How to create an HDS-eligible application

The full procedure is documented in the application lifecycle page:
[Create an HDS Application][app-create-hds].

No manual configuration is required after creation: the platform enforces HDS
constraints, including `web` processes scaled to 2 or more containers.


## How to create a Shared Resources HDS database add-on

When the parent application is HDS, the platform enforces add-on eligibility automatically.

Any database add-on created for an HDS application must be HDS-eligible. For shared resources, this means using an eligible highly available `Business` service class.
