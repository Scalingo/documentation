HDS certification is part of Scalingo's broader [compliance framework]({% post_url 2000-01-01-compliance %}). In France, it helps ensure that health data hosting is operated with security controls aligned with regulatory requirements and supports use cases with heightened security and compliance constraints.

## Is pricing different for HDS services?

No. HDS services do not incur additional costs compared to non-HDS services with equivalent specifications and commitment.
However, they are subject to additional constraints.

## What restrictions apply to HDS services?

The main constraint is that HDS workloads must use highly available (HA) resources.

### Managed Application Runtime

- Your `web` processes must be scaled to 2 or more containers to ensure high availability.

### Managed Database

- Only highly available service classes ([`Business` and `Enterprise`]({% post_url databases/about/2000-01-01-overview %}#service-classes)) of eligible databases can be used for HDS workloads.
- Scalingo for Elasticsearch®, Scalingo for MongoDB® and Scalingo for InfluxDB® are not eligible for HDS workloads.
