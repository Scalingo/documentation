Health Data Hosting (HDS) certification is part of Scalingo's broader [compliance framework][compliance]. In France, it helps ensure that health data hosting is operated with security controls aligned with regulatory requirements and supports use cases with heightened security and compliance constraints.

## When should I create an HDS resource?

You should create HDS resources when your application processes personal health data in a context subject to French HDS requirements, or when you operate for stakeholders subject to HDS compliance requirements (healthcare institutions, healthcare professionals, Health Tech publishers, and public health organizations).

In practice, if your workload must comply with reinforced requirements for security, traceability, and health data hosting in France, it must be deployed on HDS-eligible resources.


## What is the difference between standard and HDS resources?

With equivalent specifications, **HDS services do not imply a direct HDS surcharge**, but they enforce eligibility constraints that may increase the required resource sizing.

### Application Runtime

- The platform enforces `web` processes scaled to 2 or more containers to ensure high availability.

### Database

- Only highly available service classes ([`Business` and `Enterprise`][service-classes]) are eligible for HDS database workloads.
- Scalingo for Elasticsearch®, Scalingo for MongoDB®, and Scalingo for InfluxDB® are not eligible for HDS workloads.


## How to create an HDS resource

HDS must be enabled when the resource is created. Existing non-HDS resources 
cannot be converted to HDS later.

### Application Runtime

To make your application eligible for health data hosting, enable the HDS option 
when creating it.

The full procedure is documented in the application lifecycle page:
[Create an HDS Application][app-create-hds].

No manual configuration is required after creation. The platform enforces HDS
constraints, including `web` processes scaled to 2 or more containers.

### Shared Resources HDS database add-on

When the parent application is HDS, the platform automatically enforces add-on 
eligibility.

No manual configuration is required after creation. The platform automatically 
enforces HDS eligibility and uses highly available `Business` service class.

### Dedicated Resources HDS database

To make a Dedicated Resources database HDS-eligible, enable the HDS option when
creating it.

No manual configuration is required after creation. The platform automatically 
enforces HDS eligibility and uses highly available `Business` or `Enterprise` 
service class.
