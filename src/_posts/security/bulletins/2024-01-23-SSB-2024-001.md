Scalingo is committed to providing secure and reliable services to our customers. As part of our ongoing efforts to enhance security and promote best practices, we are announcing the deprecation of the public instances of Adminer and phpMyAdmin hosted by Scalingo.

This decision has been made due to the following reasons:

**Adminer is no longer maintained:** Adminer, one of the tools provided for database management, is no longer actively maintained. The lack of ongoing maintenance and updates poses a significant security risk, as vulnerabilities may not be promptly addressed.
**Best Practices for Database Connections:** It is considered a bad practice to allow direct database connections from the Internet. To align with industry best practices and enhance the security of our customers' data, Scalingo is moving away from hosting these tools publicly.

## Affected Services

Adminer and phpMyAdmin instances hosted by Scalingo at:

- <https://phpmyadmin.osc-fr1.scalingo.com/>
- <https://adminer.osc-fr1.scalingo.com/>

## Action Required

Customers are advised to transition to using Scalingo's secure methods for database access:

- **Accessing the Database Console using Scalingo CLI:** Detailed instructions can be found at [Accessing Database Console with Scalingo CLI](https://doc.scalingo.com/platform/databases/access).
- **Using an Encrypted Connection for local tools:** For accessing databases from local tools securely, please refer to [Encrypted Tunnel Documentation](https://doc.scalingo.com/platform/databases/access#encrypted-tunnel).
