Scalingo is aware of the recently reported issue regarding Elasticsearch
([CVE-2023-31418](https://discuss.elastic.co/t/elasticsearch-8-9-0-7-17-13-security-update/343616)).

This vulnerability would allow an unauthenticated user to bring down an
Elasticsearch instance by sending malformed HTTP requests.

It cannot be exploited as-is on Scalingo, because we setup our Elasticsearch
clusters with a reverse proxy which does not allow unauthenticated calls.

Still, an authenticated user could bring down a server by sending massive amounts of requests with bogus data. Don't do this !

As we can't provide any updated versions due to a licensing change by Elastic, we won't be able to provide a patched version.

## Action required
