title: SSB-2025-001 - Critical Remote Code Execution in Redis (“RediShell”)

tags: security bulletin scalingo redis rce vulnerability
cvss:
  version: 4.0
  base: 7.4
---

The vulnerability allows an authenticated user to exploit a use-after-free memory corruption bug within Redis’s embedded Lua interpreter.
A specially crafted Lua script can escape the Lua sandbox and execute arbitrary code on the Redis host.
The vulnerability was originally evaluated with a CVSS v4.0 base score of 10 but Scalingo re-evaluated it to 7.4 due to the required conditions for exploitation.

## Incident analysis

Disclosed by Redis, the vulnerability (nicknamed RediShell) affects all Redis versions supporting Lua scripting since its introduction over 13 years ago.
Redis assigned it the identifier CVE-2025-49844 and published patched versions on October 3, 2025.
If you are using a version <6.2.20 and <7.2.11, you are concerned by this vulnerability.

While the issue technically enables remote code execution, exploitation requires authenticated access and the ability to execute Lua scripts.
Therefore, the practical risk depends on configuration and exposure: internet-exposed or unauthenticated Redis instances are at highest risk.

### Remediation: what we did

Scalingo took the following actions after Redis’s disclosure:

- Built and tested the patched Redis releases provided upstream.

- Patched Scalingo's internal systems that use Redis.

- Made patched versions available for:

  - All newly provisioned Redis databases, and

  - Manual upgrade by customers via the Scalingo Dashboard or CLI.

- Scheduled an automatic upgrade for all customer Redis databases during the next maintenance window.

**No signs of exploitation were detected in Scalingo’s environment.**

## Impact

Redis databases on Scalingo are:

- Always executed in isolated Docker containers;

- Protected by strong, randomly generated passwords;

- Not exposed to the internet unless explicitly configured by the user.

Because the exploit requires authenticated access, the likelihood of exploitation on Scalingo is very low.
Even in a hypothetical successful attack, the impact would be limited to the Redis container scope—there is no path to escape the container or access other customer data.

## Incident Response

Following Redis’s disclosure:

- We performed an environment-wide scan to ensure all Redis instances were upgraded.

- We verified container isolation and password enforcement across all Redis services.

Scalingo continues to monitor upstream Redis channels and our telemetry for potential post-disclosure exploitation activity.

## Timeline

| 2025-05-16  | Vulnerability reported by Wiz Research during Pwn2Own Berlin |
| 2025-10-03  | Redis publishes its official security advisory and patches       |
| 2025-10-07  | Scalingo builds and tests patched Redis versions                 |
| 2025-10-07  | All Scalingo Redis add-ons upgraded and verified                 |
| 2025-10-07  | Public disclosure of Scalingo Security Bulletin SSB-2025-001     |

## What you should do

No immediate action required for customers using managed Redis add-ons.
These instances are automatically going to be upgraded.

Ensure that internet access for your Redis instances is only enabled if absolutely necessary.

## What we will do in the future

Scalingo will:
  
- Continue to monitor Redis security advisories and backport fixes promptly.

- Continue to strengthen automated vulnerability monitoring to increase detection capabilities.

## Product Impacts

### Scalingo PaaS

No impact on the application platform layer.

### Scalingo DBaaS Add-ons

All Redis add-ons have been patched and verified.
No other managed database services (PostgreSQL, MySQL, MongoDB, Elasticsearch, OpenSearch, InfluxDB) are affected.

### Other Scalingo Add-ons and Services

No other add-ons or services are impacted.
