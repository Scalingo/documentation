### Security Incident Response

In the event of a security incident, our operations team follows a predefined incident response plan to contain the incident and mitigate its impact. The incident response plan includes procedures for identifying the cause of the incident, containing the incident, and restoring the platform to normal operation. After the incident has been resolved, we perform a post-mortem to identify the root cause of the incident and to prevent similar incidents from occurring in the future.

### Security Incident Reporting

If you suspect a security incident, please report it to our security team at [security@scalingo.com](mailto:security@scalingo.com). We take all reports of security incidents seriously and we will investigate the incident promptly.

### Security Incident Communication

In the event of a security incident, we will communicate with our customers to keep them informed of the incident and to provide updates on the status of the incident. We will provide regular updates on the incident and we will inform our customers of any actions they need to take to protect their data. Security communication is done through our [status page](https://scalingostatus.com), and by chat support or email if necessary.

### On-Call Rotation

Our operations team is available 24/7 to respond to security incidents and to ensure the availability of the platform. We have an on-call rotation to ensure that there is always someone available to respond to security incidents and to ensure the availability of the platform.
