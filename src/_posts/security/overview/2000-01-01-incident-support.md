### Security Incident Response

In the event of a security incident, our operations team follows a predefined incident response plan to contain the
incident and mitigate its impact. The incident response plan includes procedures for identifying the cause of the
incident, containing the incident, and restoring the platform to normal operation. After the incident has been resolved,
we perform a post-mortem to identify the root cause of the incident and to prevent similar incidents from occurring in
the future.

### Security Incident Reporting

If you suspect a security incident, please report it to our security team at
[security@scalingo.com](mailto:security@scalingo.com). We take all reports of security incidents seriously and we will
investigate the incident promptly.

### Security Incident Communication

In the event of a security incident, we will communicate with our customers to keep them informed of the incident and to
provide updates on the status of the incident. We will provide regular updates on the incident and we will inform our
customers of any actions they need to take to protect their data. Security communication is done through our
[status page](https://scalingostatus.com), and by chat support or email if necessary.

### On-Call Rotation

Our operations team is available 24/7 to respond to security incidents and to ensure the availability of the platform.
We have an on-call rotation to ensure that there is always someone available to respond to security incidents and to
ensure the availability of the platform. Our on-call first response time is 15 minutes.

### Technical Support

Our technical support team is available to help you with any technical or security issues you may encounter, 5/7 from
9am to 6pm (CET). You can contact our technical support team by chat or email at
