### Disaster Recovery

We have a disaster recovery plan in place to ensure the availability of the platform in the event of a disaster. The
disaster recovery plan includes procedures for restoring the platform to normal operation and for ensuring the
availability of the platform to our customers. This plan is tested regularly to ensure that it is effective and that we
can restore the platform to normal operation in the event of a disaster.

### Business Continuity

We have a business continuity plan in place to ensure the availability of the platform in the event of a business
disruption. The business continuity plan includes procedures for restoring the platform to normal operation and for
ensuring the availability of the platform to our customers. This plan is tested regularly, in subparts, to ensure that
it is effective and that we can restore the platform to normal operation in the event of a business disruption.

The business continuity is ensured on various levels:

- Deployment redundancy
- Data redundancy
- Network redundancy
- Personnel redundancy
- Service redundancy

After each test, a post-mortem is performed to measure the effectiveness of the plan and to identify areas for improvement.
