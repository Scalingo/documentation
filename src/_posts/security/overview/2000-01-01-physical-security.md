### Datacenters

Scalingo does not have its own datacenters, but uses IaaS services to provision resources. These services use
datacenters that are certified ISO 27001, ISO 27017, ISO 27018, HDS (Region `osc-fr1`) and and can additionally have the
qualification SecNumCloud (Region `osc-secnum-fr1`). These certifications ensure that the datacenters have implemented a
high level of security to protect the data hosted on them.

### Physical Access Control

Access to the datacenters is restricted to authorized personnel only. Access is controlled by a badge system and is
monitored by video surveillance. Access to the premises hosting the processing is controlled through a combination of
zoning, visitor accompaniment, badge systems, and locked doors. In case of intrusion, there are alert mechanisms in
place to notify the appropriate personnel.

### Equipment Security

Measures are taken to ensure the physical security of servers and client workstations. This includes secure storage, the
use of security cables, privacy filters, secure data erasure before disposal, and other relevant security measures.

### Mitigation of Environmental Risks

The location of the facility is assessed for potential environmental risks such as flood-prone areas, proximity to
chemical industries, seismic or volcanic zones, etc. If there are any hazardous substances present in the area, it is
specified.

### Protection against Non-Human Risks

Fire prevention, detection, and suppression systems are implemented. Measures to prevent water damage are also in place
if applicable. Additionally, there are surveillance and backup power systems to ensure continuous electricity supply and
prompt response in case of emergencies.
