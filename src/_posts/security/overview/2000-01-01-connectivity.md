### Secure Connectivity

All data transmitted between the platform and the user is encrypted using HTTPS. This ensures that the data is protected
from eavesdropping and tampering. The allowed ciphers are regularly updated to ensure that the platform is protected
from the latest security vulnerabilities.

### Customer VPN

We offer the possibility to set up a VPN connection (OpenVPN, IPSec) between your infrastructure and the Scalingo
platform. This allows you to securely connect your infrastructure to the platform and to protect your data from
unauthorized access.
