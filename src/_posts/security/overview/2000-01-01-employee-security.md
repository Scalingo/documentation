### Security Training

All employees receive security training to ensure that they are aware of the security measures implemented by the
platform and to prevent security incidents caused by human error.

### Security Awareness

All employees are required to follow security best practices to protect the platform from security incidents. This
includes using strong passwords, enabling two-factor authentication, and following the security policies implemented by
the platform.

They are trained to detect phishing, social engineering, or impersonation attempts and to report them to the security team.
