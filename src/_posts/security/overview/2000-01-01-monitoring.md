### Monitoring

We use monitoring tools to monitor the platform for production and security incidents. The monitoring tools are
configured to alert our operations team in the event of an incident and to provide them with the information they need
to respond to the incident.

This alerting is paging the on-call team members in case of an incident. The on-call team members are responsible for
responding to the incident and for coordinating the response with other team members.

### Journaling

We use journaling to record all actions taken on the platform. The journaling is used to track changes to
the platform and to identify the cause of production and security incidents.

### Logging

The internal logs of the platform are stored in a secure, append-only, redundant storage system to ensure that the logs
are protected from unauthorized access. The logs are regularly reviewed by our operations team to identify security
incidents and to prevent similar incidents from occurring in the future.

### Incident Response

In the event of a security incident, our operations team follows a predefined incident response plan to contain the
incident and mitigate its impact. The incident response plan includes procedures for identifying the cause of the
incident, containing the incident, and restoring the platform to normal operation. After the incident has been resolved,
we perform a post-mortem to identify the root cause of the incident and to prevent similar incidents from occurring in
the future.
