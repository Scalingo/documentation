title: 'Phasing out Sandbox plans in favor of Starter plans'
---

Starting Monday, March 2, 2026, Sandbox plans can no longer be provisioned for databases (Application and Review Apps).

If a deployment, script, or API call still requests a Sandbox plan, we will automatically provision the corresponding smallest Starter plan instead. An email notification will be sent to highlight the pricing impact and prompt you to update the provisioning plan in your workflows.

Existing Sandbox databases will continue running and be progressively migrated to the corresponding smallest Starter plan.
