title: 'Managing scheduled downtime with flexible Maintenance Windows'
---

Database Maintenance Windows is the Scalingo system for scheduling the maintenance needed on your databases. This system automates maintenance operations according to your preferred schedule, minimizing the impact on your application, while facilitating continuous improvement on our side.


Each database has been assigned with a 8 hours default Maintenance Window on a weekday, from 21:00 to 05:00 UTC. However, if this timeframe doesn't align with your business requirements, you have the flexibility to adjust it as needed.


Using our CLI (version 1.31.0 and later) and soon our dashboard too, you can select the most suitable 8-hour time window with minimal impact on your business operations. 

For further insights into the Database Maintenance Windows feature, please refer to our [comprehensive documentation](/platform/databases/maintenance-windows).
