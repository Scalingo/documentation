title: 'Introducing Projects'
---

We are introducing **[Projects]({% post_url platform/projects/2000-01-01-overview %})** to help you organize and structure your applications more effectively.

Projects provide a flexible way to group your applications according to your own logic: by product, customer, environment, or any other approach that fits your needs. This makes large accounts easier to navigate and manage, while keeping resources clearly separated.

Over time, Projects will evolve into a **core building block of the Scalingo platform**, serving as the foundation for new features in billing, access management, and network security. One of the upcoming capabilities will be **Private Networks**, enabling applications within the same project to communicate securely in an isolated environment.
