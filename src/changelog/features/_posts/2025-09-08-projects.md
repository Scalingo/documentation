title: 'Introducing Projects'
---

We are introducing **[Projects]({% post_url platform/projects/2000-01-01-overview %})** to help you organize and structure your applications more effectively.

Projects provide a flexible way to group your applications according to your own logic: by product, customer, environment, or any other approach that fits your needs. This makes large accounts easier to navigate and manage, while keeping resources clearly separated.

By starting to use Projects now, you will also be preparing for upcoming **Private Networks**, which will allow applications within the same project to communicate securely in an isolated environment.
