title: 'New: Limited Collaborator Role'
---

We are introducing a new **[Limited Collaborator]({% post_url platform/user-management/teamwork/2000-01-01-roles %}#limited-collaborator)** role to give you more control over access management in your applications.

This new role is primarily intended for developers, contributors, or external contractors who need to work on your applications without being able to change configuration settings, deploy unvalidated code, or access databases.

It’s particularly well suited if:

- You work with external developers or freelancers
- You want to limit data access to a smaller, trusted group within your company
- You manage junior team members or support staff
- You’re preparing your project for stricter security or compliance requirements
