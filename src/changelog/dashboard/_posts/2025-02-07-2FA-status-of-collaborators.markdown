title: 'Collaborators Page - View and Export 2FA Status'
---

We have added a new feature to the [**Collaborators**]({% post_url platform/app/2000-01-01-collaborators.md %} page, allowing you to see whether your collaborators have enabled **Two-Factor Authentication (2FA)**.  

### What’s new?  
- Each collaborator’s **2FA status** is now displayed on the **Collaborators** page.  
- This information is also included in the **JSON** and **CSV** exports.  

This new feature helps you assess the security level of your applications and reach out to collaborators who need to improve their security settings.
