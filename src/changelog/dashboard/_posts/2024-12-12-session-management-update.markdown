title: 'Security Update: Changes to Session Management'
---

In line with OWASP recommendations, we have enhanced our session management policies.
By default, new sessions will expire after 2 hours of inactivity. Users can remember
their current browser up to 8 hours, the maximum duration recommended by OWASP.
