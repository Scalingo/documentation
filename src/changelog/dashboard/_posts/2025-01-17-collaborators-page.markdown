title: 'Overview of your collaborators and their access'
---

We have added a new page to give you a complete overview of your collaborators and their access.
This is just the beginning! In the coming weeks, we plan to add features that will make managing your collaborators even more intuitive.

* Go to [dashboard.scalingo.com/collaborators](https://dashboard.scalingo.com/collaborators)
* If you already have collaborators, youâ€™ll see a consolidated list of all the users who are collaborating on your apps
* You can click on the **Group by Apps** toggle to display a tree view of your apps and their associated collaborators.
