Please schedule intrusion tests in advance and follow the procedure described here.
Tests performed outside the approved process will activate our alerting and protective measures, for example:
banning the test IP, placing the application under increased supervision, or suspending the account.
To prevent any service disruption, contact us to arrange and authorize your tests beforehand.
