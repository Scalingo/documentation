* Scalingo is moving step by step to our redesigned dashboard!
* Starting August 12 (thursday), accessing [my.osc-fr1.scalingo.com](https://my.osc-fr1.scalingo.com) will redirect towards [dashboard.scalingo.com](https://dashboard.scalingo.com). The previous dashboard will remain accessible at [dashboard-prev.osc-fr1.scalingo.com](https://dashboard-prev.osc-fr1.scalingo.com) until the end of August. After that it will be completely cut off. The rules also apply to the `osc-secnum-fr1` dashboard.
* If you want to give any feedback on the new dashboard or share areas where you feel the previous dashboard did a better job, please send an email at support@scalingo.com!
