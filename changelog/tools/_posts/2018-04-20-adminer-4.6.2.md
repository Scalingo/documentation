[Adminer](https://www.adminer.org/) is a web application to administrate various databases (MySQL,
PostgreSQL, MongoDB and Elasticsearch). It can be seen as a phpMyAdmin for more than just MySQL
databases.  We just deployed the latest version at
[https://adminer.scalingo.com/](https://adminer.scalingo.com/).

More information on how to use it on the dedicated [doc page]({% post_url platform/databases/2000-01-01-adminer %}).
