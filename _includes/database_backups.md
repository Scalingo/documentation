If your database is in a paid plan (i.e. It's not "free plan"), we'll make automated backups of your database on a daily basis, at around 1 AM Central European Time (CET or UTC+0100). However, we don't keep those backups forever. The following rules are applied for backups storing:

* Everyday for the past 30 days (1 month)
* One per week during the 2nd and 3rd months
* One per month during the 4th, 5th and 6th months
