All databases created after the 6th of January 2019 have encryption at rest enabled. In other words,
all your data are encrypted before being stored on disk.
<br>
<br>
For databases created before this date, encryption at rest is activable on-demand through the
support. Activating it is achieved with a short downtime for your database, from seconds to minutes
depending on the amount of data.
